cytokines in serum (eg, IL1B, IL6, IL12, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1) were associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung damage in SARS patients.', '22 MERS-CoV infection was also reported to induce increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNγ, TNFα, IL15, and IL17).', '23 We noted that patients infected with 2019-nCoV also had high amounts of IL1B, IFNγ, IP10, and MCP1, probably leading to activated T-helper-1 (Th1) cell responses.', 'Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα than did those not requiring ICU admission, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity.', 'However, 2019-nCoV infection also initiated increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines (eg, IL4 and IL10) that suppress inflammation, which differs from SARS-CoV infection.', '22 Further studies are necessary to characterise the Th1 and Th2', 'In view of the high amount of cytokines induced by SARS-CoV, 22, 24 MERS-CoV, 25, 26 and 2019-nCoV infections, corticosteroids were used frequently for treatment of patients with severe illness, for possible benefit by reducing inflammatory-induced lung injury.', 'However, current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving corticosteroids did not have an effect on mortality, but rather delayed viral clearance.', '[27] [28] [29] Therefore, corticosteroids should not be routinely given systemically, according to WHO interim guidance.', '30 Among our cohort of 41 laboratory-confirmed patients with 2019-nCoV infection, corticosteroids were given to very few non-ICU cases, and low-to-moderate dose of corticosteroids were given to less than half of severely ill patients with ARDS.', 'Further evidence is urgently needed to assess whether systematic corticosteroid treatment is beneficial or harmful for patients infected with 2019-nCoV.', 'No antiviral treatment for coronavirus infection has been proven to be effective.', 'In a historical control study, 31 the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir among SARS-CoV patients was associated with substantial clinical benefit (fewer adverse clinical outcomes).', 'Arabi and colleagues initiated a placebo-controlled trial of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir, and ritonavir among patients with MERS infection in Saudi Arabia.', '32 Preclinical evidence showed the potent efficacy of remdesivir (a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleotide prodrug) to treat MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections.', '33, 34 As 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, an effective treatment has not been developed for disease resulting from this virus.', 'Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the designated hospital, a randomised controlled trial has been initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalised with 2019-nCoV infection.', 'Our study has some limitations.', 'First, for most of the 41 patients, the diagnosis was confirmed with lower respiratory tract specimens and no paired nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained to investigate the difference in the viral RNA detection rate between upper and lower respiratory tract specimens.', 'Serological detection was not done to look for 2019-nCoV antibody rises in 18 patients with undetectable viral RNA.', 'Second, with the limited number of cases, it is difficult to assess host risk factors for disease severity and mortality with multivariableadjusted methods.', 'This is a modest-sized case series of patients admitted to hospital; collection of standardised data for a larger cohort would help to further define the clinical presentation, natural history, and risk factors.', 'Further studies in outpatient, primary care, or community settings are needed to get a full picture of the spectrum of clinical severity.', 'At the same time, finding of statistical tests and p values should be interpreted with caution, and non-significant p values do not necessarily rule out difference between ICU and non-ICU patients.', 'Third, since the causative pathogen has just been identified, kinetics of viral load and antibody titres were not available.', 'Finally, the potential exposure bias in our study might account for why no paediatric or adolescent patients were reported in this cohort.', 'More effort should be made to answer these questions in future studies.', 'Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were believed to originate in bats, and these infections were transmitted directly to humans from market civets and dromedary camels, respectively.', '35 Extensive research on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has driven the discovery of many SARS-like and MERS-like coronaviruses in bats.', 'In 2013, Ge and colleagues 36 reported the whole genome sequence of a SARS-like coronavirus in bats with that ability to use human ACE2 as a receptor, thus having replication potentials in human cells.', '37 2019-nCoV still needs to be studied deeply in case it becomes a global health threat.', 'Reliable quick pathogen tests and feasible differential diagnosis based on clinical description are crucial for clinicians in their first contact with suspected patients.', 'Because of the pandemic potential of 2019-nCoV, careful surveillance is essential to monitor its future host adaption, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.', 'We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes of 41 laboratory-confirmed cases infected with 2019-nCoV.',

the cellular machinery in the interest of replication and propagation.', 'In this article, we study the latter by focusing on the translational adaptation of viral genomes to the host.', 'While previous studies on the base composition and codon usage of both DNA and RNA viruses 11, 30 have attributed most of the codon usage variability to the mutational pressure of viral genomes, our analysis proposes tropism as an important driving force.', 'By systematically interrogating all human-infecting viruses, we uncover that tissue tropism explains changes in their codon usage more than other viral properties such as type or family.', 'Therefore, as mutational pressure would act more similarly within phylogenetically closer species, such tropism-related differences in codon usage suggests that tissue-specific tRNA expression could be driving a translational selection on viral genomes.', 'Although high-throughput sequencing of tRNAs has been only recently developed, cases of natural selection of codon usage towards the host have been previously proposed.', 'For instance, codon usage of Parvovirus has been progressively adapted from dogs to cats after the host jump 43 .', 'Influenzaviruses show a similar adaptation over time of viral isolation, deviating from the codon usage of avian hosts 44, 45 .', 'However, whether these progressive changes in codon usage over time are directly driven by translational selection has remained elusive.', 'With the advent of tissue-wide datasets of tRNAs and their translational efficiencies 2 , we can now compute the Supply-to-Demand Adaptation (SDA) of all viral proteomes in different tissues.', 'From there, we then created a random forest model that predicts with high accuracy the viral tropism of proteins based on their profile of adaptation to human tissues.', 'In consequence, the tRNA-based adaptation profile of a protein is descriptive of their viral tropism, indicating that translational selection could indeed drive tropism differences of codon usage.', 'It is important to remark that viruses could still have a good SDA', 'Specifically, we therefore focus our analysis on the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, causative of the current COVID-19 pandemic.', 'As has been recently suggested based on the expression of their entry receptor 21, 22 , SARS-CoV-2 is also translationally adapted to the upper respiratory airways, as well as the lung parenchyma.', 'This upper tract tropism has indeed been linked to the higher transmissibility of the strain 21 .', 'The novel coronavirus showcases the highest SDA among all studied coronaviruses, including lung but also other tissues such as the digestive system and brain.', 'Interestingly, recent reports have shown that COVID-19 patients very frequently have problems in the digestive tract 24,46,47 as well as in neural tissue 23 One major open question in the field still persists: how much natural selection before or after zoonosis shapes the current coronavirus 50 .', 'On the one hand, viruses tend to gradually change their codon usage after a zoonotic jump 43, 45 .', 'On the other hand, given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 SDA with the phylogenetically closest bat coronavirus, it seems that a translational selection to increase SDA would have acted before the putative zoonosis from bats or other intermediate hosts.', 'Furthermore, in agreement with the highest translational potential of SARS-CoV-2 in their target tissues, a recent model of viral tropism suggested that a tradeoff exists between the efficiency of viral translation and the translational load on the host, indicating that an improved codon usage can make the difference between symptomatic and natural hosts 51 .', 'On the other hand, it is known that host tRNA pools undergo reprogramming upon viral infection of HIV-1, vaccinia virus, and influenza A virus 17, 52 .', 'In this context, differences in codon usage between early and late viral genes have been previously reported, but the directionality of such changes remained unclear 10, 53 .', 'Based on our concept of tissue-specific adaptation, we therefore validate that early replication-related proteins are better adapted to the tissue of infection.', 'Upon infection, we then unveil that changes in tRNA abundance switch the adaptation towards the expression of late structural proteins, confirming a general trend that had previously only been observed in HIV-1 17 .', 'Overall, this is the first systematic analysis establishing a link between the codon usage of human viruses and the translational efficiency of their tissue of infection.', 'This correspondence is particularly observed in early viral proteins, while late counterparts benefit from the tRNA reprogramming that underlies the process of infection.', 'We therefore envision the development of ad hoc gene therapies specifically targeting the tissue of interest.', 'Table 2 for full TCGA cancer

examination is timely and rapid and has a high positive rate.1 The extent of lung lesions is closely related to clinical symptoms.', 'Therefore, chest CT examination is irreplaceable in the preliminary screening of COVID-19.', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 has different imaging manifestations at different stages, which are mainly related to pathogenesis.', 'The lesions at the early stage of COVID-19 are relatively localized and mainly manifest as inflammatory infiltration restricted to the subpleural or peribronchovascular regions of one lung or both lungs, exhibiting patchy or segmental pure GGOs with vascular dilation (Figure 1).', 'Very few cases have negative CT findings at the early stage.', 'In the progressive stage, CT shows mainly an increased range of pure GGOs (Figure 2), the involvement of multiple lobes (Figure 3), consolidations of some lesions, and GGOs surrounding consolidated lesions (the characteristic change of the progressive stage).', 'Interlobular septal thickening and an obvious crazy-paving pattern are often present, and air bronchograms are common (Figure 4).', 'At the advanced stage, the CT manifestations of patients are similar to those in other types of pneumonia and mainly include diffuse lesions in both lungs, which are mostly consolidated lesions, and GGOs surrounding consolidated lesions, which are mostly accompanied by parenchymal bands and occasionally by a small amount of pleural effusion.', 'This CT appearance is called lung whiteout.', 'Different imaging manifestations at different stages may be associated with the pathological mechanism of viral pneumonia, which at first is prone to affect the terminal bronchioles and their surrounding pulmonary parenchyma and then develop into infiltration of pulmonary lobules and, lastly, diffuse alveolar damage.6\\n', 'In imaging diagnosis, COVID-19 is difficult to distinguish from pneumonias caused by influenza A virus, influenza B virus, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV, MERS coronavirus, and other viral pneumonias as well as bacterial pneumonia.2 Luckily, their treatment methods are similar.', 'There are no medicines specifically targeting COVID-19.', 'Viral pneumonias other than COVID-19 mainly manifest as peribronchial and perivascular interstitial inflammation that moves toward the inner part of the pulmonary interstitium, and their CT manifestations are multiple interlaced or parallel high-attenuation fibrous streaks or high-attenuation reticular patterns caused by infiltration of the interlobular septa.', 'The lesions mainly occur in the hilar and subpleural regions.7 If the pneumonia is secondary to bronchitis and does not involve the alveoli, inflammation often further develops into the bronchial wall.', 'When the bronchioles are partially or completely blocked, CT images show localized pulmonary edema and/or atelectasis.', 'The occurrence of viral pneumonia is correlated with the virulence of the virus, the transmission route, and the age and immunological status of the host.', 'In general, the incidence of viral pneumonias is higher in children than in adults.', 'In contrast, COVID-19 commonly occurs in 40- to 60-year-old patients with multiple comorbidities.', 'Compared to patients with SARS and MERS, patients with COVID-19 have no obvious complications or infections, and the disease progression is relatively slow.8\\n', 'Coronavirus disease 2019 also needs to be differentiated from bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia (MPP), and chlamydia pneumonia.9 Bacterial pneumonia occurs in the lung parenchyma and mainly manifests as bronchial pneumonia or lobar pneumonia with many inflammatory secretions in the bronchioles and alveoli.', 'Its CT manifestations are mainly extensive patchy consolidations of the lung parenchyma, and GGOs are less common.', 'Mycoplasma pneumonia commonly occurs in school-age children and adolescents but rarely occurs in adults.', 'The chest CT findings of MPP in adults are mostly bronchial wall thickening and centrilobular nodules; bronchial wall thickening is considered the manifestation of lobular pneumonia, and centrilobular nodules are small airway lesions.', 'The proportion of lung consolidation is as high as 61% in MMP.', 'In contrast, CT manifestations of COVID-19 are mainly pure GGOs at the early stage and visible consolidations in the center of the lesions at the progressive stage, but the proportion of consolidations in COVID-19 is less than that in MMP.', 'In addition, COVID-19 needs to be differentiated from lung disease caused by other diseases.10 For example, the 2 suspected patients reported above were given completely different treatments, which mainly aimed to control pneumonia and primary diseases.', 'Heart failure–induced pulmonary edema manifests differently at different stages of the disease.', 'It can be divided into 2 subtypes: pulmonary alveolar edema (type I) and interstitial pulmonary edema (type I) and interstitial pulmonary edema).', 'Computed tomography manifestations of type I pulmonary edema mainly include local or multiple GGOs, patchy high-attenuation patterns, and large patchy high-attenuation patterns in both lungs, which typically exhibit the high-attenuation butterfly sign with both hila as the center, accompanied by signs of interstitial pulmonary edema such as sporadic or local interlobular septal thickening.', 'Computed tomography manifestations of type I) and interstitial pulmonary edema', 'Although various types of pneumonias have certain imaging features, COVID-19 and other viral pneumonias, bacterial pneumonia, and some lesions share some common imaging features.12 In some cases, it is difficult to differentiate COVID-19 from them by imaging alone, and first clinical manifestations, contact history, and laboratory tests should also be considered to make the final diagnosis.', 'The conclusions are listed in Table 1.', 'In conclusion, in contrast to NAAT of SARS-CoV-2, which is restricted by false-negative results and detection limitations, chest CT, which is simple to perform and readily available, can quickly detect lung lesions and make imaging diagnoses at the early stage.', 'Therefore, it has great value in early screening, differential diagnosis, and disease severity assessment of COVID-19.', 'For patients with fever as the first symptom and with a history of exposure to COVID-19, chest CT examination should be performed as soon as possible.', 'If imaging shows the presence of typical manifestations of 2019-nCoV, even if the NAAT result for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is unavailable or negative, it is still necessary to take isolation measures to avoid the spread of the epidemic.', 'To date, our institution has examined a total of 50 suspected patients with COVID-19, 15 of whom were diagnosed with COVID-19.', 'The main clinical manifestations of confirmed cases have been fever (100%; >38°C in most cases and >37.5°C in a few cases), cough and expectoration (46.7%), headache (20%), and diarrhea (13.3%).', 'No confirmed patients have had dyspnea.', 'Imaging findings have mainly included single or multiple lesions, patchy or segmental GGOs (93.3%), and reticular markings that mainly followed peribronchovascular and subpleural distributions.', 'Interlobular septal thickening might be present, and pleural effusion and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were rarely seen.']}\n"

time.', 'Definitely, there is a need for continuous adaptation of recommendations and guidelines.', 'Nevertheless, the present review is intended to collect and to discuss aspects of the current status of approaching the management of inpatients and outpatients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'In oral and maxillofacial surgery elective procedures, urgent procedures and emergency procedures are performed.', 'In order to provide adequate healthcare resources for the treatment of critically ill COVID-19 patients, it makes sense not to perform elective procedures for a well-defined time interval that must be reevaluated on a regular basis.', 'Sometimes, there is overlap between different specialties as far as treatment of patients is concerned.', 'Obviously, this aspect is present between oral and maxillofacial surgery and ENT surgery and general dentistry.', 'In a situation in which saving healthcare resources is the priority, close

surgery and general dentistry regarding who is responsible for the variety of interventions that can be covered by both specialties in principle.', 'In times of limited resources, oral and maxillofacial surgery must focus on treatment of malignancies, traumatology, deep head and neck infection, severe hemorrhage, or severe temporomandibular joint pathologies that can be approached only by surgery.', 'General dentistry must take care of removal of teeth and related complications such as bleeding, treatment of localized abscesses in the oral cavity, treatment of pulpitis, repair of oro-antral fistulae, or craniomandibular disorders that cannot be approached by surgery.', 'The distribution of responsibilities for different diseases is independent of the SARS-CoV-2 infection status of the patient.', 'However, it is clear that the treatment of the infected patient needs an adequate infrastructure.', 'Providing this infrastructure is a political issue to a certain extent.',

continuous increase and change in knowledge, guidelines, and standard operating procedures, etc., fast and ubiquitous dissemination of knowledge and new information on problems and solutions are important to keep every stakeholder up-to-date.', 'Healthcare workers have to spend a certain percentage of their working time on continuing education and transfer of their own knowledge within their institution and in between institutions.', 'In order not to neglect the aspect of social distancing at the same time, it is important to foster concepts of technology-enhanced learning, which also includes e-learning.', 'This approach has been developed to allow the reduction of face-to-face scenarios to a minimum while the intensity of the learning experience is kept at a high level (Nkenke et al., 2012a,b) .', 'In the field of e-learning, webinars are rising in relevance significantly.', 'They allow dissemination of new information in an interactive way, even at short notice, to a large

with personal protective equipment.', 'Additionally, asymptomatic patients and patients undergoing the incubation period can be carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and can be responsible for infection transmission (Chan et al., 2020a) .', 'It is even debated whether patients in the recovery phase are potential sources of virus transmission (Rothe et al., 2020) .', 'As with every other infectious disease, the approach to the situation must be that the patient must be considered infective as long as the opposite is not proved.', 'Obviously, there is a need for sensitive, reliable, and rapid testing of patients who enter the private practice or the hospital for an urgent or emergency treatment.', 'The potential patients should be advised to first opt for a consultation on the telephone before they come for a face-to-face consultation.', 'A relevant number of issues can be clarified by telephone, helping to avoid face-to-face contact.', 'Based on current clinical evidence, it seems that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 takes place by respiratory droplets.', 'In addition, fecaleoral routes are discussed similarly to the former SARS epidemic (Drosten et al., 2003) .', 'Although COVID-19 does not include eye symptoms, it has been shown that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not limited to respiratory and fecaleoral routes, but that eye exposure may provide an additional route for the virus to enter the body .', 'The transmission routes seem to include a direct one (cough, sneeze, and droplet inhalation) as well as a contact transmission (oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes) (Lu et al., 2020) .', 'It also has been stated that SARS-CoV-2 may be airborne through aerosols produced during various procedures (Wax and Christian, 2020) .', 'In the context of transmission, it should be mentioned that an otorhinolaryngologist was the first doctor to die from COVID-19.', 'Therefore, it must be stressed that, especially, specialties such as otorhinolaryngology, general dentistry, and oral and maxillofacial surgery have to have adequate infrastructures and personal protection equipment in their inpatient and outpatient settings.', 'The aim is to protect patients as well as doctors from unnecessary infection while seeking or providing healthcare during the pandemic (Chan et al., 2020b ).', 'An early report on hospitalized patients revealed that hospital-acquired transmission accounted for 41.3% of these patients (Wang et al., 2020) .', 'Definitely, a hospital environment with inadequate viral transmission protection can be a relevant route for the spread of COVID-19.', 'Therefore, each and every measure should be taken to decrease the risk of disease transmission.', 'These measures can even include adapting the composition of mouth rinses.', 'SARS-CoV-2 seems to be sensitive to oxidation.', 'As a consequence, it has been recommended that 1% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% povidone iodine should be used in addition to the more commonly used mouth rinses (Peng et al., 2020) .', 'Especially, aerosol-generating procedures are said to be responsible for a certain percentage of viral transmission.', 'In these situations, FFP3/N99 respirators, gown, cap, eye protection,

aerosolgenerating surgery is performed in infected patients in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery.', 'If the necessity of adoption of PAPR', 'The inpatient and outpatient infrastructure must be adjusted in such a way that separate gown-up and gown-down spaces are available to prevent cross-contamination in outpatient and inpatient units.', 'All patients visiting clinical departments must have their body temperatures checked.', 'Nevertheless, infected patients are not necessarily febrile despite being COVID-19 carriers.', 'Therefore, it is also important to assess recent travel histories and contacts with infected patients.', 'Before admission to wards or before surgery in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery, testing of the patients for the virus should be performed.', 'Cancer patients are at special risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the community that does not have this kind of disease.', 'The problem is that patients with cancer are often recalled to inpatient and outpatient units for treatment and monitoring.', 'Therefore, they are at increased risk for contracting COVID-19.', 'Moreover, cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy are immunosuppressive (Kamboj and Sepkowitz, 2009; Yu et al., 2020) .', 'The latter corresponds with the fact that less than half of infected cancer patients are undergoing active treatments for cancer (Yu et al., 2020) .', 'Therefore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency of visits of cancer patients to inpatient and outpatient units must be reduced, weighing the risk of recurrence against the risk of infection.', 'For cancer patients who require treatment, proper isolation protocols must be in place to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Yu et al., 2020) .', 'Depending on the number of infected patients, there might come a time of risk of a scarcity of medical staff, ventilators, negative pressure rooms, and personal protective equipment.', 'Therefore, on one hand, it is most important to avoid infections; on the other hand, generally accepted recommendations must be developed that provide guidance in prioritizing treatments and triaging patients in oral and maxillofacial surgery (Lamontagne and Angus, 2020) .', 'The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of healthcare to the public is severe.', 'Redistribution of manpower and resources are required to meet current and future needs during the COVID-19 crisis.', 'A reduction of elective surgery is chosen to free manpower to allow room for specialties that treat COVID-19 itself and to maximize the number of available hospital beds in order to meet the prospective number of patients, including those who will become critically ill.', 'Nevertheless, urgent oncologic and emergency surgery still have to be performed.', 'The practice of triage helps to reduce unnecessary exposure to and contamination with the virus in inpatient and outpatient environments.', 'However, triage also leads to delayed patient treatment as far as elective procedures are concerned.', 'The affected patients must receive adequate treatment after the pandemic has settled.', 'Therefore, the change in orientation of oral and maxillofacial surgery from providing the full scope of the specialty with a high percentage of elective surgery to reducing the service to urgent and emergency surgery causes inconvenience for patients as well as medical staff during the COVID-19 crisis.', 'Additionally, administrative efforts such as rescheduling of patients occupy a relevant additional amount of time.', 'While the peak of the pandemic is still to come, already now strategies must be developed for a future situation in which the number of infections reduces but SARS-CoV-2 has become endemic and no effective medication of vaccination is available.']}\n"

improvement of disease without serious adverse event.', 'In our recent published study, we have revealed that CD147 is a novel identified receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection by binding with spike protein.', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection was efficiently inhibited by meplazumab targeting CD147 in a dose dependent manner.', 'All these results provide insights that CD147 acts as a functional entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and serves as a therapeutic target for inhibiting virus infection.', '13 It was reported 18.5% cases in COVID-19 were categorized as severe and critical cases, and fatality rate for critical case was 49.0% to 61.5%.', '4, 8 These studies reveal the great challenge of enhancing the therapeutic effects for severe case of COVID-19, and focus on how to conduct effective intervention as early as possible.', 'In this add-on trial, we introduced a novel therapy target to block the virus infection and inflammation, with a favorable efficacy.', 'Meplazumab treatment accelerated the improvement of COVID-19, especially in the severe and critical cases.', 'At the day 28, 69.2% severe and critical cases were discharged, and no death case was reported.', 'The improvement of chest imaging, clearance of virus, and recovering of lymphocyte count, were observed within 1 week management, which indicated that the therapeutic effects facilitated prognosis.', 'CD147 is a receptor for ligand CyPA, and its interaction with CD147 was key to the inflammation and chemotaxis.', '21 CyPA is secreted to extracellular in response to inflammatory stimuli (e.g. virus infection), activates and attracts leukocytes via its receptor CD147 to the stimulus site.', '15 We demonstrated that anti-CD147 antibody could attenuate the chemotactic index of T cells induced by CyPA.', '17 Multiple cytokines and chemokines increased significantly in patients with COVID-19, which was significantly correlated with pulmonary inflammation index of chest CT imaging.', '4.22 These results suggest that the excess immune cells migrating into lung tissue may cause uncontrolled immune response, leading to the inflammation storm, and aggravated disease.', 'We presumed that meplazumab blocked the interaction between CyPA and CD147, attenuated the chemotactic effect of CyPA, decreased the immune cells in lung tissue, and facilitated the improvement of chest radiographic.', 'In this trial, the remarkable and rapid resolution of inflammatory foci in lungs, like ground-glass opacity and consolidation, were observed in meplazumab treatment group.', 'Lymphopenia was common in patients with COVID-19 and SARS patients, and can be used as an indicator of disease severity and prognosis.', '23 75.4% patients with COVID-19 reported lymphopenia.', '24 Due to the absence of ACE2 in lymphocyte, it has been proposed that the lymphocytopenia in SARS patient is caused by the indirect mechanism, including inflammation storm, vascular cell adhesion, soluble Fas ligand, and glucocorticoids.', '12, 25 However, the SARS-CoV particles and genomic sequence were detected in a large number of circulating lymphocytes, causing destruction of lymphocytes.', '26 In this trial, lymphocyte count in meplazumab-treated patients were restored in short time.', 'CD147 is high expressed on the activated T cells, 17 which may All rights reserved.',

involved in lymphocytopenia.', 'Meplazumab interrupted this process by preventing virus invasion to keep lymphocytes survived.', 'Second, the meplazumab blocking CD147-CyPA interaction might contribute to lymphocyte elevation in peripheral blood by inhibiting the lymphocyte accumulation in pulmonary organ.', 'In summary, we establish a \"specific antibody add-on therapy model\", a combined therapeutic strategy of the specific antibody with recommended antivirus treatment, and demonstrate it safe and effective.', 'The effective dosage of antibody by timely administration attenuates the inflammation in patients with COVID-19, and facilitates the patients to get through acute exudation of pneumonia.', 'Therefore, antibody therapy can extend the therapeutic window, thus safeguard patients pass the dangerous period.', 'A favorable specific antibody drug should inhibit the virus replication and suppress the inflammation storm.', 'Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 antibody, can block the receptor of host cells, and inhibit the virus invasion and replication by interrupting spike protein from recognizing CD147 receptor.', 'Meanwhile, meplazumab blocks the CD147, the receptor of proinflammatory factor CyPA, thus suppressing the inflammation.', 'Although we get the outcomes of meplazumab treatment for COVID-19, our results are limited by the small subject size and the absence of parallel control.', 'Therefore, confirmation from larger scale and randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial is required to fully assess the efficacy and safety of meplazumab in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.', 'the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.', 'the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the

Indeed, at the end of 2019, the outbreak of Wuhan pneumonia with an unknown etiological agent, the first Disease X following WHO’s announcement was reported to WHO.', 'Shortly thereafter, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (also known as 2019-nCoV or HCoV-19), was identified to be the etiology of the Wuhan pneumonia, i.e., COVID-19 as designated by WHO.', 'Unlike SARS-CoV, live SARS-CoV-2-infected cells were found to form typical syncytium, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may mainly utilize the plasma membrane fusion pathway to enter and replicate inside host cells.', 'Consistently, in the cell–cell fusion system, SARS-CoV-2 S protein could effectively mediate the formation of syncytium between the effector cell and the target cell in the absence of an exogenous proteolytic enzyme, e.g., trypsin, while SARS-CoV S protein could not.', 'Actually, the plasma membrane fusion pathway is more efficient than the endosomal membrane fusion pathway for most viruses because the latter is more prone to activating the host cell antiviral immunity.23,24 Generally, β-B coronaviruses lack the S1/S2 furin-recognition site, and their S proteins are uncleaved in the native state.', 'For example, SARS-CoV enters into the cell mainly via the endosomal membrane fusion pathway where its S protein is cleaved by endosomal cathepsin L and activated.25 Inducing the S1/S2 furin-recognition site could significantly increase the capacity of SARS-CoV S protein to mediate cellular membrane surface infection.26 Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 harbors the S1/S2 cleavage site in its S protein, but its specific role in S protein-mediated membrane fusion and viral life-cycle remains to be further explored (Supplementary information, Fig. S7).', 'A recent report suggested that SARS-CoV-2 mainly used TMPRSS2 for plasma membrane fusion; this means that the TMPRSS2 inhibitor might constitute an option for blocking SARS-CoV-2 fusion with and entry into the host cell.27', 'The 6-HB structure formed by HR1 and HR2 regions in the S2 subunit of HCoVs plays a key role during the viral membrane fusion process, which makes it one of the most important targets for drug design.', 'In previous studies, we have found that HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 could form a stable coiled-coil complex, but the detailed conformations remain unknown.', 'According to the X-ray crystallographic analysis of the complex formed by HR1 and HR2 of SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 2b), it is a typical 6-HB fusion core structure similar to those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Although the amino acid sequences of HR2 domain from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are fully identical, multiple residue differences occur in the HR1 domain of SARS-CoV-2.', 'However, instead of weakening the interaction between HR1 and HR2, such unilateral difference seems to form new interactions in some regions and enhance the existing ones in other regions (Fig. 3).', 'When K991 in SARS-CoV HR1 was replaced with S929 in SARS-CoV2 HR1, a new, strong hydrogen bond was formed with a distance of 2.4 Å. K933 forms a new interaction with N1192 in SARS-CoV-2 with a distance of 2.7 Å, whereas the corresponding position in SARS-CoV has no such interaction.', 'In the other two regions, E918 binds to R1166 and K929 binds to E1163 in SARS-CoV, both of which were enhanced in SARS-CoV-2.', 'These results suggest that this new HCoV has evolved with improved binding affinity between HR1 and HR2 domains, which may accelerate the viral membrane fusion process and enhance viral infectivity or transmissibility.', 'A recent study also found that the binding affinity between ACE2 receptor on the host cell and RBD in S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more than 10-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, which may also be associated with the increased infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.12', 'The conjugation of cholesterol to viral entry inhibitor has been proved to be an effective strategy to enhance the antiviral activity, such as C34 peptide for HIV-1.28 However, the mechanism of this enhancement, especially the role of cholesterol group in the C-terminal tail of entry inhibitor, is still unclear.', 'There is a possibility that the cholesterol group could anchor to the target membrane to facilitate the binding of inhibitor to the HR1 targets.', 'However, we noticed that binding affinity between EK1C4 and SARS-CoV-2-HR1P is significantly enhanced than EK1 peptide alone, which suggested that cholesterol group may be involved in binding to HR1P directly (Supplementary information, Fig. S4).', 'Therefore, using structural simulation and docking method, we predicted a possible model of EK1C4 in binding with SARS-CoV-2 HR1P (Supplementary information, Fig. S8).', 'In this model, the EK1C4 peptide anchors to one of the three hydrophobic grooves of HR1 trimer via its EK1 moiety, and also anchors to another adjacent hydrophobic groove of HR1 trimer via its cholesterol moiety.', 'The cholesterol group of EK1C4 may bind to HR1P through hydrophobic interactions, while several hydrogen bonds may form between HR1 and helical region of EK1C4.', 'The intermediated GSGSG-PEG4 linker of EK1C4 peptide is just enough to connect these two moieties on the two binding targets.', 'Admittedly, the exact mechanism and structure of EK1C4 need more studies in the future.', 'In the past few decades, the viral HR1 domain has been proved to be an important target for the development of viral fusion and entry inhibitors.', 'In the early outbreak of MERS, we quickly solved the 6-HB fusion core structure formed by MERS-CoV S protein HR1 and HR2 domains and designed the fusion inhibitory peptide HR2P-M2 which proved to be highly effective in blocking its spike protein-mediated membrane fusion and inhibit in vitro MERS-CoV infection.16', 'The results from animal experiments showed that intranasal application of HR2P-M2 peptide could effectively protect mice from MERS-CoV infection with reduction of virus titers in the lung more than 1000-fold.29 However, the MERS-CoV HR2P-M2 peptide could not inhibit SARS-CoV infection, suggesting that this peptide lacks cross-inhibitory activity against other β-CoVs, such as SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs.', 'To be well prepared for combating the emerging coronaviruses with epidemic or pandemic potential, we designed and synthesized the first pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, and found that EK1 exhibited potent inhibitory activity against all HCoVs that we tested, including SARS-CoV and MARS-CoV, as well as bat SARSr-CoVs.', 'As expected, we recently have shown that EK1 is also effective in inhibiting infection of the novel β-CoV, SARS-CoV-2.15 We then optimized EK1 peptide in hopes of improving its fusion inhibitory activity.', 'Indeed, we found that one of the modified EK1 peptides, EK1C4, was 226-fold and 149-fold more potent against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and PsV infection, respectively, than EK1.', 'EK1C4 also showed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against infection by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and other HCoVs.', 'EK1C4 showed prolonged and significant prophylactic effect against HCoV-OC43 infection in mouse model, suggesting that EK1C4 may also be used as an inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo.', 'Consistent with other studies,30 HCoV-OC43 was shown as a typical neurotropic virus in the mouse model, and quickly entered and established infection in mouse brain tissue, leading to the relatively weak therapeutic effect of EK1C4 via intranasal administration.', 'However, SARS-CoV-2 mainly infected and caused severe pathological changes in human lung tissue.4 Therefore, EK1C4 administered intranasally is expected to have good therapeutic potential against SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'Currently, no specific anti-CoV therapeutics or prophylactics have been used in clinics for treatment or prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'A number of nonspecific antiviral drugs, including IFN, lopinavir-ritonavir (HIV protease inhibitors), chloroquine, favipiravir (T-705) and remdesivir (GS-5734), have been used in clinics in China to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection.31 Their in vivo efficacies still require further confirmation.', 'Their potential use for treatment of infection by other coronaviruses and emerging coronaviruses in the future is unclear.', 'Compared with these clinically used nonspecific antiviral drugs, EK1C4 has more advantages for treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'First, the sequence of its target, the HR1 domain in S2 subunit of S protein, is highly conserved.', 'Therefore, EK1C4 possesses a high genetic barrier to resistance and cannot easily induce drug-resistant mutations.', 'Second, EK1C4 can be used in an intranasal formulation to prevent coronavirus infection.', 'The small bottles can be carried easily by persons who will have close contact with infected patients or high-risk populations.', 'Third, EK1C4 can be used in inhalation formulation for treatment of patients to reduce the viral loads in their lungs, thus attenuating the acute lung injury caused by viral infection and reducing the chance to spread the virions to the closely contacted persons.', 'The inhalation equipment can be used in home or hotel room, reducing the expense of staying in hospitals.', 'Fourth, EK1C4 is expected to be safe to humans because it will be used locally, not systemically, and peptide drugs are generally safer than chemical drugs.', 'Fifth, because of its broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus activity, EK1C4 can be used for treatment and prevention of infection by not only SARS-CoV-2, but also other HCoVs.', 'Sixth, recently 103 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been identified,32 but we found that both HR1 and HR2 domains among those reported genomes show 100% identity (Supplementary information, Fig. S9), indicating the high conservation of EK1C4 target.', 'In the meantime, the HR2 derived peptides have much larger interface on HR1 domain, making it more resistant to the viral mutations.', 'Therefore, EK1C4 shows exceptional promise to be developed as the first pan-CoV fusion inhibitor-based antiviral therapeutic or prophylactic for treatment or prevention of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV and the future reemerging SARS-CoV and emerging SARSr-CoVs.']}\n"

epidemiological data, anaesthetic techniques and management, complications and outcomes of maternal patients with and without COVID-19 in the 3 hospitals in Hubei Province.', 'The results indicated that the high rates of emergency and general anaesthesia use were likely due to the high risk for parturients and newborn.', 'Consisting with previous reports 9 , the clinical manifestation of parturients with COVID-19 had mild symptoms and none severe phenotype if the disease was in our study.', \"Thus, the intrathecal anaesthesia was the first choice for parturients with COVID-19 in order to reduce medical staff exposing to virus via patient's airway.\", 'Spinal anaesthesia is a safe and quick technique for cesarean delivery due to its quality of sensory blockade and reliability.', 'However, the risk of high level of sensory blockade and the high incidence and degree of hypotension may be the disadvantages when compared with epidural anaesthesia.', 'Although none of the mothers who received intrathecal anaesthesia for delivery had any complications in this study, considering that SARS-CoV-2 virus may also invade the central nervous system 10 , epidural anaesthesia seems to be superior for patients with COVID-19.', 'Due to the limited tactile sensation of PPE, it is necessary to use ultrasound guide epidural procedure for avoiding unintentional dural puncture and subarachnoid catheterization.', \"In the period of COVID-19 outbreak, routine prenatal examination was limited by traffic control and isolation policy in place, and hence pathological pregnancy can't be found timely, which may be the reasons for the high emergency caesarean delivery and general anaesthesia use in the COVID-19 patients in this study.\", 'Although general anaesthesia would induce or exacerbate pulmonary complications in parturients 11 with COVID-19, the cesarean delivery under general anaesthesia is necessarily to be used for fetal distress, potential contraindication of intrathecal anaesthesia, as well as intrathecal anaesthesia failure.', 'The rapid-sequence induction by using propofol, rocuronium and remifentanil was used in our COVID-19 patients and the excellent maternal hemodynamic stability was noted.', 'However, the possible risk of short-time neonatal depression and required short periods of mask ventilation or tactile stimulation of the neonate were found.', 'However, in this study, either intravenous or inhalational induction was not difference in term of the safety of maternal and neonatal and the risk infection of medical staff.', 'To avoid hemorrhage resulted from uterine atony, inhalational sevoflurane was switched into intravenous anaesthetics after umbilical cordligation.', 'Notably, PPE increased the difficult in airway management

high incidence of intraoperative hypotension in the COVID-19 patients.', 'The risk of hypotension was likely due to anaesthesia induced sympathetic inhibition, preoperative fasting.', 'A recent study showed that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor 13 , suggesting that the high susceptible of the circulatory system to SARS-CoV-2 infection might be one of the reasons of hypotension in this study.', 'Together with liquid loading and left lateral position, prophylactic phenylephrine was effective and safe in maintaining blood pressure.', 'Prophylactic uterotonic agents (oxytocin) treatment and controlled umbilical cord traction during placenta delivery were also the effective ways to prevent hemorrhage-induced hypotension.', 'As such, it is necessary for COVID-19 parturients to have a contingency plan in place for the high risk of obstetric hemorrhage.', 'Although a little evidence supported that supplemental oxygen improves maternal and neonatal outcomes 14 , parturients with COVID-19 were routinely treated with oxygen during operation to prevent maternal and infant hypoxia.', 'However, considering the oxygen free radical production and atelectasis, continuous inspiration of high oxygen concentration was not used 15 .', 'It is critical to apply the lung expansion and positive end-expiratory pressure technique for COVID-19 patients receiving general anaesthesia to eliminate atelectasis formation 16 .', 'As for parturients with COVID-19 undergoing intrathecal anaesthesia, the deep-breathing exercises were also encouraged.', 'Our data showed a down-trend in the number of parturients with COVID-19, which implied the importance of proper home quarantine and personal protection to reduce exposure, and ultimately reduced the chance of COVID-19 infection in pregnant women.', \"Besides, the delivery of infected parturients to designated hospitals was to ensure the safety of the pregnant women and their newborns, while preventing and controlling newborns' infection with SARS-Cov-2.\", 'Potential multi-target organ damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women may increase the chance of COVID-19 parturients received caesarean section.', 'Taken more precaution care for those patients are necessary.', 'Cesarean delivery increased the risk of microenvironmental aerosols.', 'Consequently, the fetus should be cleaned of amniotic fluid and blood from the mouth and nose and then transferred to incubator rapidly after delivery to reduce neonatal infection.', 'Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 virus may also invade the central nervous system, indicating that the risk of maternal nervous system injury cannot be ignored.', 'While, none was diagnosed with postpartum depression in the present study, which might be attributed to the implementation of multimode analgesia management in our patient population 17 .', 'In summary, the current data suggested that the proper home quarantine and personal protection can help to reduce the risk of parturients infected with SARS-Cov-2.', 'Anaesthesia-related complications occurred more frequently in the COVID-19 parturients, while their newborn born also have a high risk of distress and high admission to NICU.', 'From our experience, spinal or epidural anaesthesia can be safely used for such patients.', 'General anaesthesia in general results in more hypotension and open airway

independent model parameters.', 'As long as it is plausible that additional measures will not change model parameters other than λ our approach can be extend by adding further change points and then be reused for further short-term forecasts.', 'Under novel developments, such as the introduction of novel, effective therapies influencing the recovery rate µ our approach provides the algorithmic blueprint for modeling and detecting such change points as well.', 'Our model comparison also ruled out models without a change point or with only one change point.', 'While this may seem trivial, it has important consequences for making the short term forecasts that decision makers rely on.', 'Demonstrating and quantifying the effect of change points in the past enables us to project the effects of change points in the recent past on the future development of case numbers, even if they are not apparent yet in the observed case numbers.', 'Hence, it is important to look out for and identify potential change points as early as possible, and incorporate them appropriately into the forecast model.', 'Our results rely on a straight-forward implementation of time-varying spreading rates, that assumed spreading rates to be constant in time, except for rate changes occurring only at the time of interventions -the change points -where we formulated broad prior distributions for the new spreading rate and the time-point of the change.', 'Our results seem to indicate that this modeling approach is sufficient at present for Germany: While we introduced fairly broad priors on the spreading rates we obtained a fairly narrow posterior distribution for the changed spreading rates (Fig. 4 B) , indicating that the assumption of discrete steps in the spreading rates is viable.', 'With respect to the posterior distributions for the dates of the change points, we also found the data to provide valuable information in narrowing the posterior distribution for the first change point, compared to the prior, and in slightly moving the posterior mode for the second change point.', 'Change point detection and interpretation hinges on proper estimation on the delay D between a new infection and recording a newly confirmed case.', 'Thus, it seems important to assess whether the posterior median value of D = 9.5 days is at least compatible with what is known.', 'In our model D sums up at least three separate factors, i.e. the biological incubation period, and an additional delay from first very mild symptoms to symptoms warranting testing under the constraint of limiting testing capacities, and a possible delay before a testing slot is available.', \"At present, the incubation is reported by the WHO as being in a broad range from 1-14 days with a mean of 5 days [29] , and the WHO states that 'symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually'.\", 'A gradual onset of symptoms may delay testing because people tend to wait before asking to be tested, or may be asked to wait as testing in more urgent cases is prioritized.', 'Adding a mean of 5 days of incubation period to the patient waiting for three days after gradual symptom onset before asking for a test, and waiting 1 days for a test would be a plausible scenario in Germany.', 'The resulting 9 days are compatible with the median and spread of the posterior median of D = 9.5 we found, given the wide range of durations for the incubation period.', 'It should be noted in addition, that once mass-testing for asymptomatic members of the general population is available, or even mandatory, a change point for D will certainly have to be added to the model.', 'Since most of the forecast uncertainty comes from scenario assumptions and uncertainties in model parameters, we purposely kept the dynamic model as simple as possible for it to remain tractable.', 'Focusing on a simple model, we have excluded many details that are relevant for precise modelling of epidemics, especially at very late stages or in small populations.', 'Such details include explicit (modeling of) incubation times [20, 30] , spatial heterogeneity [15, 20] , isolation [14, 30] , or subsampling effects hiding undetected cases even

'Addition of treatment with remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that if in vivo drug potency is high, then rapid elimination of virus is possible.', 'Potent therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when infected people typically develop symptoms, are predicted to decrease shedding duration and intensity of the effector immune response, but to have little effect on viral area under the curve, which is driven by high levels of early SARS CoV-2 replication.', 'Potent therapy dosed prior to peak viral load, when infection is usually pre-symptomatic, is predicted to be the only option to lower viral area under the curve.', 'We also identify that clinically meaningful drug resistance is less likely to emerge with a highly potent agent that is dosed after peak viral load.', 'Our results support an early test and treat approach for COVID-19, but also demonstrate the need to identify early viral shedding kinetic features that are the most predictive surrogates of clinical severity and transmission risk.', 'We next simulated therapy at day 10 of infection (Fig. 4a) , when severely infected people often seek hospital

viral clearance slope in clinical trials can be used in concert with our model to directly estimate the in vivo intracellular EC50 value of remdesivir in each treated patient.', 'The model can then be used to project the effect of increasing or decreasing doses in subsequent trials.', 'SARS CoV-2 infection is characterized by a stereotypical viral kinetic pattern with a high peak viral load during the first several days of infection, a subsequent short rapid decay period followed by a slower clearance phase of variable duration, and a final, rapid elimination phase.', 'Our mathematical model reproduces this data and explains that the transition from first to second phase viral decay is governed by a density dependent term in which a massive die off of infected cell occurs during peak viremia.', 'Viral clearance rate slows considerably once the viral load decreases below a threshold of ~10 5 RNA copies.', 'A late slowly expanding cytolytic T cell response is predicted to induce eradication of infected cells in the upper airway 2-20 days later.', 'The timing of this final response appears to be variable among infected people.', 'Moreover, it is unknown if cessation of viral replication in the nasopharynx guarantees the same result in the lung or other anatomic compartments (8) .', 'We built therapy simulations on top of these natural kinetics to glean knowledge about the possible impact of antiviral therapies.', 'While accurate prediction is impossible in the absence of clinical trial data, we are able to make several observations which highlight the importance of off treatment viral dynamics in understanding treatment effects.', 'Our results can guide future study design and assist in interpretation of forthcoming trial data in multiple ways.', 'First, it is critical to know whether in vitro potency assessments of remdesivir, hydroxycholorquine and bNAbs can be projected onto human infection.', 'We previously demonstrated that in vivo IC50 values for antiviral agents can exceed estimates derived from cell cultures experiments by a multiple of 5-10 for small molecule antiviral drugs (19) .', 'A similar observation has been hypothesized for HIV

in vivo.', 'Whatever the case, if in vitro potency measurements of hydroxycholoroquine and remdesivir overestimate in vivo activity, or if higher intracellular levels are required than in plasma, then these drugs may be less effective in clinical trials.', 'Higher dosing may be a possible solution to circumvent this issue.', 'Second, effective dosing after symptom development predicts rapid subsequent elimination of infected.', 'Most current clinical trials are focused primarily on hospitalized patients whereas our results and those from other COVID models suggest that treatment in the days immediately following symptom onset will decrease the duration of detectable viral shedding (24, 25) .', 'Our model also predicts that early treatment will limit the extent of the cytolytic immune response required to clear infection.', 'If either of these outcomes are correlates of progression to severe disease and transmission risk, then as with HIV (26), influenza (27) , and Ebola (28), early test and treat is a vital, currently overlooked strategy.', 'Third, effective dosing soon after onset of symptoms is predicted to have an insignificant effect on viral load AUC.', 'This phenomenon occurs because the amount of virus produced per hour at the early peak is far higher than the amount produced per day during the lower viral load second decay phase.', 'This finding provides a cautionary message: if subsequent disease severity and development is imprinted during the high viral load, pre-symptomatic phase of infection, then early antiviral therapy could theoretically eliminate further shedding without altering clinical outcomes.', 'Moreover, if extremely high viral load periods are responsible for most transmissions as suggested by the 5-day

suggests that while development of drug resistance will occur commonly during COVID-19 treatment with remdesivir, it is unlikely to predispose to treatment failure provided the drug is potent against the predominant susceptible strain.', 'Resistant variants will likely be present at low levels relative to susceptible strains making transmission of resistance far less likely.', 'Important exceptions may occur in immunocompromised hosts who might shed respiratory viruses for longer and at higher levels, thereby increasing the chance of de novo resistance (32) , or in the context of only

'Of all included patients, 37 (71%) required mechanical ventilation and 35 (67%) had ARDS.', 'Since no specialised medication to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified at this time, the mainstay of treatment has been supportive care.', 'Patients are being treated in isolation, and their close contacts are being quarantined.', 'For non-critically ill patients, close followup is likely to be sufficient to manage the disease.', '1-3 For critically ill patients, however, aggressive treatments and intensive care are needed.', 'To our knowledge, this is the first study to characterise critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2.', 'In three previously published studies of crtically ill patients, the patient numbers were too small to summarise the characteristics and mortality of these patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.', '1, 2, 5 Like SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans, and these viruses are all related to high mortality in critically ill patients.', '12 However, the mortality rate in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort is higher than that previously seen in critically ill patients with SARS.', 'In a cohort of 38 critically ill patients with SARS from 13 hospitals in Canada, 29 (76%) patients required mechanical ventilation, 13 (43%) patients had died at 28 days, and six (16%) patients remained on mechanical ventilation.', '8 17 (38%) of 45 patients and 14 (26%) of 54 patients who were critically ill with SARS infection were also reported to have died at 28 days in a Singapore cohort 13 and a Hong Kong cohort, 14 respectively.', 'The mortality rate in our cohort is likely to be higher than that seen in critically ill patients with MERS infection.', 'In a cohort of 12 patients with MERS from two hospitals in Saudi Arabia, seven (58%) patients had died at 90 days.', '15 Since the follow-up time is shorter in our cohort, we postulate that the mortality rate would be higher after 28 days than that seen in patients with MERS-CoV.', 'The fundamental pathophysiology of severe viral pneumonia is severe ARDS.', 'Men and people of an older age (>65 years) are more likely to develop ARDS than women or those of a younger age.', 'Therefore, it is reasonable that the mortality at 28 days of severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is similar to the mortality of severe ARDS, which is near 50%.', '17 With a substantial increase in the number of critically ill patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, more provisional ICUs are being established in Wuhan, China.', 'Qualified specialists are coming to Wuhan from other provinces of China and are currently working in these provisional ICUs, fever clinics, and newly constructed hospitals.', '18 As the clinical capacity to treat patients improves, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is expected to decrease.', 'As mentioned in previous studies, nearly 70% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 were men.', '1, 2 The patients are older in our study than in previous studies.', '1, 2 We observed that non-survivors were older than survivors.', 'Based on previous studies, evidence suggests that older, male patients are the most susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 which is supported by our data.', 'As previously reported, patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease are at increased risk of becoming critically ill or dying if they have SARS-CoV-2 infection.', '2, 5 In our cohort, fever is the most common symptom in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, which is in accordance with previous studies, but not all patients had fever.', '1, 2, 5 We also found that fever was not detected at the onset of illness in six (11·5%), and that it was in fact detected 2-8 days later.', 'The delay of fever manifestation hinders early identification of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2-if patients are asymptomatic identification of suspected cases is more difficult.', '19, 20 The median duration from onset of symptoms to radiological confirmation of pneumonia was 5 (3-7) days, meaning that early or repeated radiological examinations are useful in screening patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.', '4 As for laboratory tests, lymphocytopenia occurred in more than 80% of critically ill patients in our cohort.', 'Lymphocytopenia is a prominent feature of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV infection because targeted invasion by SARS-CoV viral particles damages the cytoplasmic component of the lymphocyte and causes its destruction.', '21 Additionally, lymphocytopenia is also common in the critically ill patients with MERS infection, which is the result of apoptosis of lymphocytes.', '22, 23 Therefore, we postulate that necrosis or apoptosis of lymphocytes also induces lymphocytopenia in critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'In a previous study, mainly in non-critical patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, 35% of patients had only mild lymphocytopenia, 2 suggesting that the severity of lymphocytopenia reflects the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'Mechanical ventilation is the main supportive treatment for critically ill patients.', 'The PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was lower in our patients than in patients admitted to Zhongnan Hospital.', '5 The substantial difference in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio between survivors and non-survivors in our study, indicates this ratio is associated with the severity of illness and thus prognosis.', 'Barotrauma seems less severe in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who are being mechanically ventilated than that seen in mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV. In our study, barotrauma occurred in only one (2%) patient, who had been hospitalised for nearly 1 month, and he is currently on a ventilator and receiving ECMO.', 'In patients with SARS, barotrauma occurred in about 25% of patients on mechanical ventilation.', '14 The lower occurrence of barotrauma in our cohort is probably related to the widely accepted strategy of protective ventilation in mainland China.', '24 At the same time, prone position and ECMO have been used to treat patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.', 'Without solid evidence, nearly half of the patients were given antiviral agents, and more than half were given intravenous glucocorticoids.', 'Patients treated with lopinavir were from an ongoing clinical trial registered on Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2000029308).', 'Remdesivir was given to the first patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the USA.', '4 Trials on remdesivir are about to recruit both mild to moderate patients (NCT04252664) and severe patients (NCT04257656) infected with SARS-CoV-2.', 'Although, intravenous glucocorticoids were commonly used in patients with severe SARS or MERS pneumonia, their efficacy remains controversial and their use to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is also controversial.', '5, 25 An ongoing clinical trial (NCT04244591) might shed some light on the safety and efficacy of these drugs as treatment.', 'This study has several limitations.', 'First, only 52 critically ill patients were included.', 'However, the population from which they were sampled was much larger than that of the three studies previously published.', '1, 2, 5 We included all the critically ill patients being cared for in the ICU of Jin Yin-tan hospital who met the inclusion criteria.', 'Due to the exploratory nature of the study, which was not driven by formal hypotheses, the sample size calculation was waived.', 'Instead, we hope that the findings presented here will encourage a larger cohort study or potentially some randomly controlled trials.', 'Second, some specific information from the ICU was missing, such as mechanical ventilation settings.', 'The data on radiographical examination, supportive treatment, living status, and the duration from ICU admission to death, however, are indisputable.', 'Third, this is a retrospective study.', 'The data in this study permit a preliminary assessment of the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.', 'Further studies are still needed.', 'In conclusion, the mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is high.', 'The survival term of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission.', 'Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death.', 'The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain to hospital critical care resources, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced.', 'The primary outcome was 28-day mortality after ICU admission.', 'Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation.', 'ARDS and shock were defined according to the guidance of WHO for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).', '6 Acute kidney injury was identified on the basis of serum creatinine.', '11 Cardiac injury was diagnosed if the serum concentration of hypersensitive cardiac troponin I (hsTNI']}\n"

degradation of functional integrity.', 'VHP [8] appears to be most effective across all masks.', 'There is recent preprint data that supports this possibility [4] .', 'We demonstrated that the VHP method allows at least 10 cycles of decontamination without impairment of mask function.', 'The disadvantage of VHP is its limited availability.', 'iHP is commonly used in most hospitals for decontamination of high value reusable equipment such as endoscopes [9] .', 'However, we were able to demonstrate only that the N95 masks tolerated one cycle of treatment.', 'With 5 or more cycles,

of aeration following item exposure to the gas is required to eliminate chemical residua.', 'This result in an extremely long cycle time of more than 20 hours compared to less than one hour for other decontamination methods.', 'Despite these drawbacks, some institutions in poorly resourced setting may not have iHP or VHP.', 'For that reason, our finding that all four mask models tolerate at least 3 cycles of EtO decontamination without significant structural or functional deterioration may be useful.', 'However, we would recommend against the use of this approach unless and until there is advanced testing to ensure that all traces of ethylene oxide and its related breakdown products are entirely eliminated with sufficient aeration [12] .', 'Finally, as expected, standard autoclaving is effective in eliminating any viable virus.', 'Surprisingly, however, 3 of the 4 respirator mask models tolerated up to 10 cycles while maintaining structural and functional integrity according to our testing.', 'Although all masks maintained integrity after one autoclave cycle, only the more rigid, non-pleated 3M 1860 model demonstrated loss of function with more than a single autoclave cycle.', 'The other layered fabric, pleated models all retained integrity with up to 10 autoclave cycles.', 'This finding will be highly relevant to institutions in poorly resourced areas of the world in that one might reasonably hope that autoclaves would be available in any recognized hospital around the world.', 'Unfortunately, we were unable to examine the differences in mask materials and construction that might contribute to the failure of the 3M 1860 model compared to the others due to the proprietary nature of the technology.', 'Single use of N95 masks for each patient encounter is ideal and recommended; unfortunately, the resource stress due to the current COVID-19 crisis has breached this ideal.', 'According to public reporting, extended use and re-use of N95 masks has become common in hospitals in areas where SARS-CoV-2 is high.', 'This risks functional failure of N95 masks, spread of infection to wearers and increased risk of virus transmission from health care workers to others.', 'Our data suggests that all decontamination methods are effective for at least one decontamination cycle without loss of structural integrity.', 'However, neither iHP nor EtO gas are recommended at this time due to limited tolerance of N95 masked tested to repeat cycles, prolonged cycle times and/or potential toxicity.', 'Both VHP and autoclaving can be used to decontaminate N95 masks through multiple cycles without loss of filtering function.', 'Although VHP has more limited availability, autoclaves, which can be used on a subset of N95 mask types, may be easily accessed by any health care institution when N95 mask shortages occur.', \"Although we tested the functional integrity of decontaminated masks via quantitative fit testing, our testing cannot take into account the respirator's ability to withstand the rough handling that extended wear by health care workers, with stress and perspiration can inflict.\", 'Another limitation of this study is that our findings

clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of some cases with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia .', 'METHODS: In this retrospective study, we extracted the data on 95 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan Xinzhou District People’s Hospital from January 16th to February 25th, 2020.', 'Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and abnormal radiologic findings.', 'Outcomes were followed up until March 2th, 2020.', 'RESULTS: Higher temperature, blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, alanine aminotransferase activity, aspartate aminotransferase activity, α - hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity, lactate dehydrogenase activity and creatine kinase activity were related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, and so were lower lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage and total protein level.', 'Age below 40 or above 60 years old, male, higher Creatinine level, and lower platelet count also seemed related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, however the P values were greater than 0.05, which mean under the same condition studies of larger samples are needed in the future.', 'CONCLUSION: Multiple factors were related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, and more related studies are needed in the future.', 'According to the results of our study, higher temperature, blood leukocyte count, neutrophil count, neutrophil percentage, C-reactive protein level, D-dimer level, alanine aminotransferase activity, aspartate aminotransferase activity, α - hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity, lactate dehydrogenase activity and creatine kinase activity were related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, and so were lower lymphocyte count, lymphocyte percentage and total protein level.', 'Age below 40 or above 60 years old, male, higher Creatinine level, and lower platelet count also seemed related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint, however the P values were greater than 0.05, which mean under the same condition studies of larger samples are needed in the future.', 'Different from the results of previous studies [2, 9, 10], our study indicated that severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint had more to do with leukocytosis rather than leukopenia.', 'This difference is mainly because of the different inclusion criteria and evaluation index we used.', 'The leukocytosis was unlikely to be caused by bacterial infection because we excluded common bacteria or viruses associated with community-acquired pneumonia and procalcitonin level of all patients in our study was no greater than 0.5 ng/ml.', 'We think that the leukocytosis was a reflection of excessive inflammation.', 'The excessive inflammation was also reflected by the much higher C-reactive protein level of patients with severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia as shown by Table 2.', 'In our study, the leukocytosis was always accompanied by an increase in neutrophil count and neutrophil percentage.', 'That makes sense because the overwhelming majority of blood leukocyte was neutrophils, and the highest percentage of neutrophils was 97.5% in our study.', 'As described above, neutrophilia was related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint.', 'However, Up to now most of the research have focused on the role of lymphocyte in 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.', 'We think that the role of neutrophils in 2019 novel novel coronavirus pneumonia shouldn’t be ignored and further related researches are needed in the future.', 'The leukocytosis was also accompanied by a decrease in lymphocyte count and lymphocyte percentage.', 'It should be noted that leukocytosis was not incompatible with lymphopenia, and lymphopenia could occur both when blood leukocyte count incarease and decrease.', 'Consistent with previous studies [11], lymphopenia was more severe and common in patients with severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.', 'As suggested, the lymphopenia was probably caused by the translocation of lymphocyte from peripheral blood to lungs [11].', 'We also evaluated the Coagulation, liver and renal function of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.', 'In light of our observation, D-dimer was the most common abnormal coagulation index.', 'As described above, higher D-dimer level was strongly related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint (R1 = 0.717, P1<0.001, R2 = 0.737, P<0.001).', 'The increased D-dimer level reflected a hypercoagulable state, which might promote pulmonary microthrombosis.', 'This hypothesis need to be further confirmed.', 'Alanine aminotransferase activity and aspartate aminotransferase activity were used to evaluate liver function in our study.', 'As shown by Table 2, about half of the patients were found liver fuction injury, and liver fuction injury was related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint.', 'However we didn’t see an obvious difference between 40 and 80 U/L group and >80 U/L group, and most of the liver fucntion were temporary and reversible.', 'That means the liver function injury might be caused by multiple factors: immunity, inflammation and drugs.', 'Creatinine level was used to evaluate renal function in our study.', 'A recent research indicated that the 2019 novel coronavirus was found in patients’ urine [12].', 'However, we didn’t see an obvious difference in creatinine level between severe group and non-severe group.', 'Therefore, the influence of 2019 novel coronavirus on renal function need to be further studied though the 2019 novel coronavirus was found in patients’ urine.', 'Besides, higherα- hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity, lactate dehydrogenase activity and creatine kinase activity were related to severe cases and reach of composite endpoint.', 'In our study, 92.6% of the patients had an increase in α- hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity, 77.9% of the patients had an increase in lactate dehydrogenase activity, and 29.5% of the patients had an increase in creatine kinase activity.', 'α- hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity, lactate dehydrogenase activity and creatine kinase activity were usually used to evalue the degree of myocardial injury.', 'However, we had no direct radiological or histopathological evidence to prove that myocardial injury really happened.', 'Thus the influence of 2019 novel coronavirus on heart also need to be further studied.', 'In addition we used the total protein level to evaluate the nutritional condition of patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.', 'According to our study, about 68.4% of the patients had a decrease in total protein level.', 'Lower total protein level correlated with severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint.', 'The decrease in total protein level reflected a high consumption state of nutrition, which suggested that patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia needed more nutrition during hospitalization.', 'Moreover, we compared the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings between death group and survival group as shown by Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2.', 'Age above 60 years old, male, blood leukocyte count > 10*10^9/L, neutrophil count > 7*10^9/L, neutrophil percentage > 85%, lymphocyte count <0.4* 10^9/L, lymphocyte percentage<10%, C-reactive protein level >150 mg/L, D-dimer level >1 mg/L, α - hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity>540 U/L and lactate dehydrogenase activity>720 U/L were obviously related to a consequence of death.', 'In some degree, our research was different from pevious similiar studies [2, 9, 10].', 'Firstly we adopted a different inclusion criteria:patients with chronic or severe underlying diseases were excluded as described above.', 'Secondly we applied different evaluation index:when assessing the relationship between candidates with the severity of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia, we used the highest or lowest level of candidates during hospitalization while the previous studies mainly used the fixed value of candidates on admission.', 'We adopted different inclusion criteria and evaluation index for the following reasons: Firstly, chronic or severe underlying diseases could make it difficult to fully assess the role of 2019 novel coronavirus in 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia without too much interference.', 'Secondly, the laboratory findings of patients on admission could be unrepresentative because laboratory findings may vary depending on patient’s condition, and many cases that reached composite endpoint during hospitalization could be non-severe cases on admission.', 'However, there were also some limitaions of our study.', 'The main limitations included the reseach type (Single center retrospective study) and a lack of cases.', 'And it was not credible to conduct a multivariate analysis because of the lack of cases in our study.', 'Above are the main points of our study.', 'Our study was different from pevious similiar studies because of the different inclusion criteria and evaluation index we applied, which offered another perspective on the relationship between various factors and 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.', 'Different from previous study we found that severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint had more to do with leukocytosis rather than leukopenia.', 'Leukocytosis was always accompanied by an increase in neutrophil count and neutrophil percentage.', 'The role of neutrophils in 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia shouldn’t be ignored and further related researches are needed in the future.', 'Consistent with previous studies, lymphopenia was found more severe and common in patients with severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia.', 'The lymphopenia was probably caused by the translocation of lymphocyte from peripheral blood to lungs [11].', 'Besides higher D-dimer level and impaired liver function were related to severe 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint.', 'The increased D-dimer level reflected a hypercoagulable state, which might promote pulmonary microthrombosis.', 'This hypothesis need to be further confirmed.', 'Most of the liver fucntion were temporary and reversible, and the liver function injury might be caused by multiple factors: immunity, inflammation and drugs.', 'However, we didn’t see an obvious difference in creatinine level between severe group and non-severe group.', 'In addition, higherα- hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase activity, lactate dehydrogenase activity and creatine kinase activity were related to severe cases and reach of composite endpoint.', 'The influence of 2019 novel coronavirus on heart also need to be further studied.', 'Furthermore the decrease in total protein level reflected a high consumption state of nutrition, which suggested that patients with 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia need more nutrition during hospitalization.', 'In summary, multiple factors were found related to the severity of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia and composite endpoint.', 'More related studies are needed in the future.']}\n"

(Chen et al., 2020 , Huang et al., 2020 , Zhu et al., 2020 .', 'With the continuous improvement of modern imaging technology, imaging examination is more conducive to the objective assessment and early detection of lung abnormality.', 'In view of the current situation that images conform to features of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia while the etiology test is negative at initial until the subsequent repeated tests are positive (Xie et al., 2020) , combing images with clinical features is necessary to diagnosis.', 'Therefore, in our retrospective J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f study, we evaluated the epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory data of those with abnormal imaging findings.', 'The imaging findings of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia are similar to acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and

common symptoms, followed by sputum production, which was consistent with former report (Chen et al., 2020) .', 'Different from former report, which tended to infect older (median 55.5y), man (68%) with underlying medical condition (50%), the average age of novel coronavirus pneumonia was 46.65±13.82y, the gender ratio was close to 1:1 and the rate of patients with coexisting condition was 28.8%

away from J o u', 'r n a l P r e -p r o o f Wuhan and SARS-CoV-2 itself may has virulence changes during human-to-human dissemination, including epidemiological features.', 'Our results may suggest general susceptibility.', 'Compared with patients with normal imaging findings, the average age of patient with pneumonia appearance was older and the rate of at least one coexisting medical condition was higher.', 'This may suggest that relatively older patients and accompanying with chronic diseases are prone to have lung injury.', 'Interestingly, the rate of exposure history from Wuhan and/or contact with confirmed patients was higher and the time from onset to SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmation was shorter in non-pneumonia patients.', 'A possible explanation for these results were that those patients were in the state of medical observation.', 'Once they were presented with any discomfort, they were requested to test whether the SARS-CoV-2 was positive and even some patients were initiative to ask for testing.', 'Besides, we identified significantly higher rate of symptoms of fever, cough, sputum production and headache.', 'The rate of sore throat of patients with abnormal images was significantly lower than that of the counterpart.', 'Since former report indicated that the initial and early-progress radiograph can be normal (Holshue et al., 2020) , the clinical symptoms were not typical and obvious.', 'The imaging of non-pneumonia patients at the initial of admission may gradually progress.', 'As there was no obvious abnormality in CT examination of patients with positive nucleic acid test, which suggested that there might be some lag between X-ray and CT examination, those patients should be monitored closely in case of timely treatment.', 'However, different J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f from patients infected with H1N1 that diarrhea is associated with chest X-ray abnormalities (Cao et al., 2009) , the difference of gastrointestinal symptoms of two groups in our study were not significant.', 'One possible explanation is that SARS-CoV-2 can bind to ACE2 of intestinal tract (Hao Zhang ZK, Wan et al., 2020) while H1N1 binds to Saα2, 3Gal receptor (Riquelme et al., 2009) , but the specific mechanism is not clear at present.', 'Laboratory results were also monitored, as we found that the patients with imaging abnormalities had lower lymphocytes, albumin, serum sodium levels and higher lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels.', 'This finding may suggest that that having pneumonia may be associated with severe disease, and patients tended to have more severe clinical features, which was in accordance with lower oxygenation index, an index to evaluate respiratory function and the severity of the disease.', 'For further study, radiograph score which may be helpful for rough estimation lung lesions was proposed.', 'Then we found a significant negative correlation (ρ=-0.657, P<0.001) between radiograph score and oxygenation index.', 'Therefore, we guess the more involvement of lobes, the worse pulmonary functions.', 'Currently, no effective antiviral therapy for COVID-19 was confirmed (Zhang and Liu, 2020) .', \"Interferon-α, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Arbidol were used according to previous experience, however, there's a lack of evidence of unified treatment plan.\", 'A significant higher rate of glucocorticoid application in patients with abnormal imaging than that the counterpart.', 'A former study showed proper use of corticosteroid in critical SARS reduced the mortality (Chen et al., 2006) .', 'Thus, patients with multiple lobes involvement may be considered for corticosteroid to control the progression.', 'Oxygen J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f therapy plays a key role in supportive care of patients.', 'Generally, patients with hypoxemia (PaO2 <60mmHg or SaO2<90% under the condition of air) or with symptom of dyspnea may be considered for it by nasal cannula or mask.', 'When the symptom or hypoxemia is improved (SaO2>90% or the level of PaO2 reach to 60-70mmHg), the flow of oxygen can be gradually reduced and even stopped.', 'Otherwise, high flow oxygen inhalation or noninvasive ventilation is considered and invasive ventilation can be adopted if the disease still progress (Medicine, 2020) .', 'However, some patients may be administrated with low flow oxygen therapy on admission in order to reduce the burden of lung.', 'In our study, we also found the rate of oxygen therapy in patients with abnormal imaging was significantly higher, which may be related to lower oxygenation index.', 'In view of the current stage to explore a standard treatment regimen, we are not sure early use of oxygen therapy is helpful for prognosis, which can be further discussed.', 'We also in depth analyzed the predictive factors of severe/critical novel coronavirus pneumonia.', 'Patients with the symptoms of shortness of breath and nausea and vomiting tended to be severe, and the similar results related to H1N1 pneumonia had been revealed in previous report, showing that the symptoms mentioned above were risk factors (Kanchana et al., 2013 , Na et al., 2011 .',

identified, however, it is still lack prediction model for disease progression.', 'In conclusion, there are some certain characteristics in chest imaging of COVID-19.', 'And we reported the difference of specific epidemiological and clinical features of between patients with abnormal or normal imaging, including fever, cough and sputum production and relatively poor laboratory results.', 'Symptoms of muscle ache, shortness of breath and nausea and vomiting, lower lymphocytes and higher serum creatinine and radiograph score were predictive factors for severe/critical subtype.']}\n"

[12] [13] [14] [15] [16] To our knowledge, this is the first report to date that describes the temporal clinical progression of COVID-19.', 'In the current study, most of the cases were mild as evidenced by relatively low rates of ICU admission and high rate of cure rate.', 'This is inconsistent with a recent report which showed more than 80% of COVID-19 cases were mild in China.', 'However, nearly 10% were severe and critical, indicating that exploring the clinical progression and possible mechanisms is essential to the disease control.', 'The clinical progression of COVID-19 in our patients showed a biphasic pattern.', 'The first phase was characterised by fever, cough, fatigue and other systemic symptoms.', 'In consistent with previous studies, we found that fever was the most common symptom in patients with COVID-19.', 'As high as 94.3% of the patients in this study, including those who were afebrile on admission had fever.', 'Guan et al. recently showed that only 43.8% of the patients with COVID-19 on presentation but developed fever in 87.9% following hospitalization, indicating the afebrile patients may be at the early stage of the disease.', '15 During this first phase, consistent with fever, the disease progressed as evidenced by radiological worsening within 7 days after onset of symptoms.', 'The disease progression during this time could be explained by uncontrolled viral replication as most majority of the patients showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2 PCR from their upper respiratory specimen.', 'As the disease progressed into week 2, symptoms began to relieve in most of the patients.', '10 days after onset of symptoms, half of the patients were estimated to restore normal body temperature.', 'The duration of fever was comparable to that in patients with SARS (11.4 days), but longer than those with MERS (8 days [range, 0-54 days]) and other coronavirus diseases.', '[18] [19] [20] However, different from SARS, whose patients frequently had recurrence of fever in week 2, most of the patients with COVID-19 had normal temperature thereafter.', '21 In line with defervescence, half of the patients also became PCR negative with their upper respiratory tract samples.', 'In addition, radiological improvement was observed in 94.5% of the patients whose radiological images showed worsening in the first week.', 'The median time to viral clearance in this study was 11 days after onset of symptoms, which was significantly shorter than that in MERS (17 days), indicating it is virulence maybe lower than MERS.', '19 Actually, most of the patients are able to clear the virus and their clinical course fit the biphasic model well.', 'However, viral clearance was observed in only a small proportion of patients in ICU.', 'Therefore, the clinical progression in these severe cases may not fit this biphasic model.', 'Indeed, patients admitted to ICU were unable to defervesce without corticosteroid therapy or had significantly longer duration of fever compared with those in the non-ICU group.', 'Persistent fever, lung damage and diseases progression could be partially explained by uncontrolled viral replication.', 'To reduce the risk of disease progression and poor outcome, an effective antiviral to early reduce the viral load may be important.', 'Several drugs are potential candidates to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication, including remdesivir which is under clinical trial.', '5 The host immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 may also contribute substantially to COVID-19 pathogenesis.', 'In the current study, both older age and lower CD4 T cells count, indicators of immunosuppression, were significantly associated with ICU admission.', 'For our patients who stayed in ICU, elevated interleukin 6 levels had been observed (data not shown), which is in consistent with the previous reports.', '12 , 22 Therefore, the persistence of COVID-19 induced excessive but aberrant non-effective response which is associated with cytokine storm.', '11 , 23 A small proportion of patients developed ARDS early in the clinical course and five of the patients in ICU did not improve significantly after viral control.', 'Consistently, inflammation persists after viral clearance in SARS.', '21 Taken together, these evidences indicate that disease progression may be a result of an over exuberant host response.', 'Along this line, apart from effective antiviral agents which could decrease viral load at the early stage and in turn result in decreased immunopathological damage, the role of host-directed therapy could be an important tool to reduce the mortality.', '24 Theoretically, corticosteroid treatment could have a role in the treatment of COVID-19 as it suppress lung inflammation.', 'Despite of fever persistence and radiological worsening in the first week, most of the patients had normal temperature and improvement in images with or without supportive therapy from the second week after onset of symptoms.', 'Most importantly, corticosteroid had been shown to delay clearance of MERS-CoV from respiratory tract and SARS-CoV from blood, respectively.', '25 , 26 In the current study, delayed COVID-19 clearance was associated with ICU admission.', 'Therefore, in agreement with the WHO guideline, we are against the usage of corticosteroid for the treatment of COVID-19.', '4 , 27 There are some limitations of our study.', 'First, a small proportion the patients were still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission.', 'Therefore, clinical outcomes in these patients were not available and continued observations are still needed.', 'Second, we did not test SARS-CoV-2 daily for everybody.', 'Hence, the actual duration to viral clearance should be shorter than the estimated one.', 'Meanwhile, we did not quantify the viral load of the SARS-CoV-2 and false negative of the PCR result for upper respiratory sample has also been reported.', '15 For that reason, studies on the dynamic changes of the viral load are still warranted.', 'In summary, the majority of COVID-19 cases are mild.', 'The two phase pattern of the disease progression suggests that early control of viral

lopinavir–ritonavir treatment in Covid-19 could have clinical benefit is an important one that requires further study.', 'The finding is consistent with studies showing that patients with SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia have progression in the second week of illness1 and with the time-to-treatment effects observed in previous antiviral studies in SARS20 and severe influenza.21-23 In addition, we found that the numbers of lopinavir–ritonavir recipients who had serious complications (acute kidney injury and secondary infections) or requiring noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure were fewer than in those not receiving treatment.', 'These observations are hypothesis-generating and require additional studies to determine whether lopinavir–ritonavir treatment given at a certain stage of illness can reduce some complications in Covid-19.', 'We did not find that adding lopinavir–ritonavir treatment reduced viral RNA loads or duration of viral RNA detectability as compared with standard supportive care alone.', 'SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still detected in 40.7% of the patients in the lopinavir–ritonavir group at end of the trial (day 28).', 'A recent report showed that the median duration of viral shedding in Covid-19 was 20 days in patients with severe illness and could be as long as 37 days.24 Neither that study nor the current one found evidence that lopinavir–ritonavir exerted a significant antiviral effect.', 'The reasons for the apparent lack of antiviral effect are uncertain, but the sampling methods used in the current trial were most likely suboptimal.', 'Samples were taken only intermittently (on days 1, 5, 10, 14, 21, and 28), and more frequent sampling in the first 5 days could have provided more detailed characterization of viral load kinetics in the two groups over this critical period.', 'In addition, previous studies have shown that throat-swab specimens have lower viral loads than nasopharyngeal samples,25 and importantly, we were unable to do sampling of lower respiratory tract secretions.', 'Of note, depending on cell type used, the 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of lopinavir in vitro for SARS-CoV has ranged from 4.0 to 10.7 μg per milliliter,5,6,8 although other studies reported that lopinavir was inactive26 or that higher concentrations (25 μg per milliliter) were required for inhibition.7 For MERS-CoV, the EC50 values have ranged from 5 to approximately 7 μg per milliliter).1,8,13 Both the mean peak (9.6 μg per milliliter) and trough (5.5 μg per milliliter) serum concentrations of lopinavir in adults just approach these concentrations.', 'Whether the EC50 value is an adequate threshold and whether unbound lopinavir concentrations in human plasma are sufficient for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 are questionable.1', 'Nearly 14% of lopinavir–ritonavir recipients were unable to complete the full 14-day course of administration.', 'This was due primarily to gastrointestinal adverse events, including anorexia, nausea, abdominal discomfort, or diarrhea, as well as two serious adverse events, both acute gastritis.', 'Two recipients had self-limited skin eruptions.', 'Such side effects, including the risks of hepatic injury, pancreatitis, more severe cutaneous eruptions, and QT prolongation, and the potential for multiple drug interactions due to CYP3A inhibition, are well documented with this drug combination.', 'The side-effect profile observed in the current trial arouses concern about the use of higher or more prolonged lopinavir–ritonavir dose regimens in efforts to improve outcomes.', 'Our trial has several limitations.', 'In particular, the trial was not blinded, so it is possible that knowledge of the treatment assignment might have influenced clinical decision-making that could have affected the ordinal scale measurements we used.', 'We will continue to follow these patients to evaluate their long-term prognosis.', 'The characteristics of the patients at baseline were generally balanced across the two groups, but the somewhat higher throat viral loads in the lopinavir–ritonavir group raise the possibility that this group had more viral replication.', 'Although we did not observe differences between groups in the frequency of use of concurrent pharmacologic interventions, such as glucocorticoids, this might have been another confounder.', 'In addition, approximately 45% and 40% of the patients in lopinavir–ritonavir group had positive RNA detection by throat swabs on day 14 and day 28, respectively, but we do not know if infectious virus was still present, since we did not attempt virus isolation or assess the possible emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir.', 'Finally, we do not have data on the lopinavir exposure levels in these seriously and often critically ill patients.', 'In conclusion, we found that lopinavir–ritonavir treatment did not significantly accelerate clinical improvement, reduce mortality, or diminish throat viral RNA detectability in patients with serious Covid-19.', 'These early data should inform future studies to assess this and other medication in the treatment of infection with SARS-CoV-2.', 'Whether combining lopinavir–ritonavir with other antiviral agents, as has been done in SARS5,20 and is being studied in MERS-CoV,15 might enhance antiviral effects and improve clinical outcomes remains to be determined.']}\n"

'However, this study had several limitations.', 'The study sample size was small, and a cross-sectional study design was used, which may have prevented the identification of other associations between social capital and sleep.', 'Also, social capital was measured using the PSCI-16 questionnaire, and the data relied on the ability of the individual to interpret the questions and provide accurate responses, but these responses were not verified objectively.', 'Therefore, some causal relationships may have been missed.', 'Further cohort studies with more samples should be performed, and

contributed to the poor clinical outcomes in some patients.', 'Third, the estimated duration of viral shedding is limited by the frequency of respiratory specimen collection, lack of quantitative

symptoms as well as abnormal liver-associated enzymes in patients who are infected.', \"These are postulated to be related to the virus's use of ACE-2 receptors located on certain intestinal cells, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes.\", 'This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19.', 'A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients can present initially with only digestive complaints.', 'The most common digestive symptoms are anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.', 'Liver-related transaminases are elevated in a substantial proportion of patients, although generally only mildly elevated.', 'Currently it does not appear that severity of digestive symptoms corresponds to severity of COVID-19 clinical course, however, more severe alterations in liver enzymes may correlate with worse clinical course.', 'Given use of antiviral and antibacterial agents in sicker patients, drug-induced liver injury cannot be ruled out either in these cases.', 'Although viral RNA can be detected in stool, it is unclear whether fecal-oral transmission can be achieved by the virus.', 'As further data becomes available, our understanding of the digestive manifestations of COVID-19 will continue to evolve.', 'The virus known as SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19, has caused a global pandemic in a few short months.', 'As of March 23, 2020, there have been over 350,000 confirmed cases globally, and over 35,000 in the United States.', 'Although the virus primarily presents as a lower respiratory tract infection and is transmitted via respiratory droplets, there are multiple gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of the disease.', 'This brief review summarizes the available limited data on digestive manifestations of COVID-19.', 'Many parallels in virology can be made between the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and prior epidemics related to coronavirus, including the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002-2003.', 'During that epidemic, up to 73% of patients had diarrhea, generally within the first week of the illness.', \"1 The pathophysiologic mechanism postulated for this, as well as for the occurrence of digestive symptoms during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, is thought to be related to the virus's strong affinity for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor which is located in multiple human cell types, including both lung AT2 cells (accounting for the virus's pulmonary toxicity), and certain enterocytes in the ileum and colon.\", '2 ACE2 is partly responsible for mediating inflammation, which could explain occurrence of diarrhea.', '3 In fact, the binding efficiency is thought to be stronger for SARS-CoV-2 than the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak of 2002, which could likely explain its high rate of transmission to others.', 'The binding of virus to primary intestinal epithelial cells also raises the prospect of fecal-oral transmission, which is as of yet unconfirmed for SARS-CoV-2.', 'The largest and most comprehensive study evaluating digestive signs and symptoms in patients with COVID-19 hails from the viral epicenter in Wuhan, where investigators retrospectively reviewed all 1141 cases admitted to a single hospital over an approximately 7 week period.', '2 This revealed that 16% of patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms only.', 'Of these 183 patients, the most common symptoms included loss of appetite.', 'Nausea and vomiting occurred in two-third of the patients, diarrhea in 37%, and abdominal pain in 25% of those who presented with GI symptoms.', 'AST and ALT were both mildly elevated in majority of patients.', 'Notably, the study is retrospective in nature with a relatively small sample size, thus these results may not be generalizable.', 'However, it provides a good starting point from which the managing clinician can put the digestive symptoms of COVID-19 patients in context.', 'Another study characterizing the digestive symptoms of patients with COVID-19 is a cross-sectional descriptive study of 204 patients from Hubei province, China, who presented to one of 3 hospitals in January and February of 2020.', '4 All patients were confirmed to have COVID-19 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR', 'In contrast to the above study, another study of 1099 patients from China showed that the most common symptoms on admission were fever (43.8%) and cough (67.8%).', '5 Less common were gastrointestinal symptoms with 5% (55/1099) of patients presenting with nausea or vomiting and 3.8% (42/1099) of patients presenting with diarrhea.', 'Similarly, in a single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in China, 10.1% (14/138) of patients had diarrhea and/or nausea, but the proportion of patients with only digestive symptoms was not outlined.', '6 To date, there has not been a study of COVID-19 patients in the United States that reports on gastrointestinal symptoms.', 'In a case series of 21 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Washington State, the initial symptoms were shortness of breath (76%), fever (52%), and cough (48%) but the authors do not report on other symptoms.', '7 As such, more data will be necessary to gain a clearer understanding of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19.', 'More importantly it is not known whether there is any correlation between those with gastrointestinal symptoms and worse outcomes.', 'Another question that is increasingly being asked in the medical community is whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmissible by the fecal-oral route.', 'The above studies did not test for RNA of the virus in the stool, so correlation cannot be made between digestive symptoms and active viral RNA replication in the digestive tract.', 'However, a case report of a 25-year-old female who presented with respiratory symptoms and fever suggested that the virus could be excreted in feces.', '2 Ten days after the initial presentation, she underwent real-time PCR of a pharyngeal sample that was negative for SARS-CoV-2, but a separate fecal sample was positive.', 'Over the following 7 days she had 4 additional samples from the respiratory tract, all of which were negative for SARS-CoV-2.', 'This suggests that her only documented source of virus was in the gastrointestinal tract, and thus may have been transmitted via the fecal-oral route, although this is not proven.', 'In addition, the first case of COVID-19 in the United States presented with a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting along with a dry cough and passed a loose bowel movement on hospital day 2.', '9 The stool and respiratory specimens later tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 again highlighting the possibility for viral shedding and potentially transmission in the stool.', 'Interestingly, in a recent Singaporean study, 50% of patients with COVID-19 had SARS-CoV-2 detected in their stool samples, but detection of this did not correlate with digestive symptoms.', 'With regard to liver-related complications of COVID-19, a varying degree of liver test abnormalities has been described in affected patients.', 'In one study, total bilirubin, AST and ALT was elevated in 10 %, 21% and 22% of patients respectively.', '5 Hitherto, no cases of acute liver failure have been reported.', 'Liver dysfunction is seen more in patients with more severe disease upon presentation.', 'It is difficult to separate the independent effect of viral infection from various treatment modalities, including antibiotics and experimental antiviral drugs that were utilized in these patients.', 'In addition these changes could be nonspecific abnormalities related to the infection, sepsis or hypoxia.', 'Other laboratory abnormalities such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and creatinine kinase were more common in patients who were sicker on presentation or who died.', 'The limited information on liver histology showed micro vesicular steatosis, and lobular and portal inflammation.', '11 Since ACE2 receptors are seen in the hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, it is not surprising that the liver is also involved with COVID-19 infection, as there may be an upregulation of ACE2 receptors in the presence of this viral infection.', '12 The cytokine storm and ischemic hypoxic reperfusion also may a place role in those with severe hepatocellular damage.', 'Underlying liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis B could have contributed to elevated liver enzyme abnormalities as most of these studies are reported from China, which has a high prevalence of hepatitis B. Further characterization of liver injury and its independent role in mortality will be defined in future studies.', 'Until then, physicians need to be cautious when using experimental drugs in these patients as many of these drugs are likely to eliminated by the liver.', 'As can be seen with this brief review of limited available data, the gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of COVID-19 are protean, and as data continue to be published on this pandemic, clinicians will gain a better understanding of this disease.', 'However, it is clear with the current data that digestive symptoms and abnormal liver-associated enzymes play a prominent role in a significant number of patients, and in some small number of cases, may in fact be the only presenting feature.', 'Thus we must be vigilant in considering COVID-19 even in the atypical patients, as confirmation of more patients at time of presentation will prove critically in stemming the growth of this pandemic.']}\n"

similar compounds or creating derivatives of this inhibitor, and finding those compounds that are predicted to have a higher affinity for the new target structure than the original one.', 'This would be expected to work for SARS-CoV-2 proteins (such as Mpro) using SARS-CoV proteins as templates.', 'However, our in-depth analysis indicates a very different situation taking place, with major shape

differences in binding sites plasticity.', 'The smaller binding cavity of the SARS-CoV-2 enlarged significantly in the presence of a highly hydrophobic cosolvent.', 'The benzene hot-spots were detected deep inside the cavity, and also near the C44-P52 loop.', 'In contrast, in the case of the SARS-CoV, benzene hot-spots were located only in the vicinity of the C44-P52 loop.', 'Such a conclusion may also imply that a sufficiently potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV and/or SARS-CoV-2 Mpros needs to be able to open its way to the active site before it can successfully bind to its cavity.',

486, 483, 494 and 501 (442, 472, 479, 480 and 487 in SARS) of the RBD of SARS favors the interaction between the RBD of SARS and hACE2 (Cui et al., 2019) .', 'Likewise, homology modeling studies found favorable interactions between the residues occupying these positions in the SARS2 RBD and the human receptor .', 'The cornerstone of these favorable interactions is the complementarity of the RBDs with hot spots 31 and 353.', 'These are salt bridges between K31 and E35 and between D38 and K353 of ACE2 which are buried in a hydrophobic environment (see Figure.', 'In the cases of SARS2 and SARS, Q493 (N479 in SARS) and N501 (T487 in SARS) add support to the hot spots according to these previous studies.', 'These observations should also hold for the Rs4231 strain, however the N501A change in the later compared to SARS2 (A488 in Rs4231) add little support to hot spot 353.', 'In this case, to continue permitting human infection, the large favorable contribution of R480 in Rs4231 to the free energy of binding could compensate the weak support provided by A488 to hot spot 353.', 'Interestingly, K353 is the residue forming the largest network of contacts with the analyzed RBDs among those belonging to both hot spots.', 'Our simulations also show that in SARS2 and SARS the RBD amino acids with the largest contribution to the free energy of binding, K417 and R426 (see Table 3 ) respectively, do not interact with any hot spot residue.', 'Instead, they interact with D30 of hACE2 in the SARS2 complex and with E329 of the human receptor in the SARS complex.', 'This could indicate that interactions additional to those previously identified with the hACE2 hotspots could be critical for the stabilization of the RDB-human receptor complexes.', 'Finally, we analyzed the possible reasons for the predicted negative impact that the G496D mutation has on the predicted free energies of binding of the RBD to hACE2.', 'As depicted in Figure 2 , G496 directly interacts with K353 in hot spot 353 and its mutation interferes with the D38-K353 salt bridge.', 'Specifically, D496 of the RDB point to D38 of hACE yields a high electric repulsion between these amino acids.', 'Consequently, this portion of the RBD is pushed to a position further from hACE2 than that observed in the wild type receptor, resulting in the reduction of its network of contacts with K353.', 'As a result, the binding of the RBD to hACE2 is considerably inhibited and unlikely to occur.', 'A priority in ongoing research is to better understand coronavirus evolution, with specific interests in understanding the role of selection pressures in viral evolution, and clarifying how viral strains can infect novel hosts.', 'Our experiments suggest that there are sites under positive selection in the S-protein gene of SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses, particularly in a region that we called RPS (Region under Positive Selection) inside of the RBD.', 'However, we have identified that by in large, sites in this region (and overall, in the S-protein gene) are under purifying selection.', 'Particularly, for the site D496G, the presence of aspartic acid seems indispensable for the interaction with the hACE2.', 'Additionally, we performed MD simulations and free energies of binding predictions for five different complexes of coronaviruses that do and do not infect human cells.', 'Our results suggest that as long as no disrupting interference occur with both salt bridges at hot spots 31 and 353 coronaviruses are able to bind with hACE2.', 'Modeling results suggest that interference with the hot spot 353 could be and effective strategy for inhibiting the recognition of the RBD of the SARS-COV-2 spike protein by its human host receptor ACE2 and hence prevent infections.', 'Although additional simulations and experiments are required, all evidence suggests that the mutation of D496 in the bat variants of the coronaviruses permit infection of human cells.', 'Giving the large contribution of SARS2 K417 to the free energy of binding of the RBD to hACE2 we propose that blocking its interaction with the receptor D30 could be a promising strategy for future drug discovery efforts.']}\n"

patients with COVID-19.', 'More than 40% of them had evidence of kidney disease, with elevated serum creatinine and BUN values in over 13% of them.', 'Strikingly, the presence of kidney disease was associated with greater in-hospital mortality.', 'Multiple organ involvement including the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and kidney have been reported during the course of SARS in 2003 6 and very recently in patients with COVID-19.', '7 One possible explanation of the high prevalence of kidney involvement at hospital admission is that some the patients with COVID-19 had a past history of chronic kidney disease.', 'Such patients have a proinflammatory state with functional defects in innate and adaptive immune cell populations 8 and are known to have a higher risk for upper respiratory tract infection 9 and pneumonia.', 'Of note, the median time period between the first symptoms and signs of COVID-19 and hospital admission was slightly more than a week in our study.', 'An alternative explanation is that many patients with COVID-19 could not be admitted in the very early stage of disease outbreak because of the acutely increasing, large number of patients and limited availability of hospital beds in Wuhan.', 'Earlier admission to hospital might have helped to prevent disease spread and deterioration.', 'This is the first study showing an association between kidney involvement and poor outcome in patients with COVID-19.', 'We found that patients with elevated baseline serum creatinine were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit and to undergo mechanical ventilation, suggesting that kidney disease on admission represented a higher risk of deterioration.', 'It has been reported previously that kidney injury was associated with an increased risk of death in patients with influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and SARS.', '5, 11 In our study, e d i t o r i a l : s p e c i a l r e p o r t indicators of kidney involvement at admission were associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death even after adjustment for potential confounders.', 'This observation indicated poor prognosis regardless of initial COVID-19 severity and general physical condition.', 'Monitoring kidney function must therefore be emphasized even in patients with mild respiratory symptoms, and altered kidney function should be given particular attention after admission in clinical practice.', 'Early detection and treatment of renal abnormalities, including adequate hemodynamic support and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs, may help to improve the vital prognosis of COVID-19.', 'AKI results from an abrupt loss of kidney function and is strongly associated with increased mortality and morbidity.', '12 We found that patients with elevated serum creatinine were more likely to develop AKI during hospitalization, which is consistent with study in SARS.', '5 It is therefore important to increase the awareness of AKI in those who entered the hospital with an elevated serum creatinine.', 'In our cohort, the detection rate of AKI in patients with COVID-19 was 5.1%, which is in keeping with recent reports of small sample size 1,4,7,13 and much higher than the 0.5% of a large observational study.', '14 This may be explained by an extremely high proportion of severely sick patients in a previous case series and only 15.7% in the large observational study.', 'In our cohort study, 42.7% of patients were severely ill, and this may explain the higher detection rate of AKI in clinic practice in Wuhan.', 'Importantly, the present method of detecting AKI is mainly based on acute changes in serum creatinine and the frequency of serum creatinine tests has a substantial impact on detection rate.', '15 In a nationwide crosssectional survey of hospitalize adult patients in China, the detection rate of AKI was only 0.99% by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (Kidney Disease:', 'Improving Global Outcomes', 'The etiology of kidney disease involvement in patients with COVID-19 is likely to be multifactorial.', 'First, the novel coronavirus may exert direct cytopathic effects on kidney tissue.', 'This is supported by the

novel coronavirus uses angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2', 'We compared the medications on the first day of admission and during the hospitalization in patients with AKI and non-AKI.', 'We found that patients with AKI were more likely to have higher proportion of glucocorticoid and lower proportion of antiviral drugs and reninangiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors treatment on admission.', 'The difference in the use of glucocorticoids may be explained by the condition of patients with AKI that was more severe, thus physicians tended to use glucocorticoids in the most critically ill patients, even if there is a controversy on the use of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID-19.', '22, 23 However, the oral antiviral drugs, including umifenovir, oseltamivir, and lopinavir with ritonavir, were preferred in moderate patients on admission.', 'Given that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the safety and potential effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 should be carefully considered.', '24 These potentially harmful effects may account for the low proportion of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors used by physicians in our cohort, especially in patients with AKI who had higher level of creatinine on admission.', 'Due to the small number of patients with AKI and the bias in different therapy of patients with COVID-19, causal relationship between drug and AKI in patients with COVID-19 remains undetermined.', 'Even though this study included a large number of patients from a tertiary teaching hospital in Wuhan, it has several limitations.', 'First, an accurate baseline serum creatinine was not available, which may have led to an underestimation of AKI or erroneous associations.', 'Second, although we attempted to adjust for many confounders, other unmeasured or unknown confounders might have played a role.', 'Third, clinical data of patients after discharge were lacking, so we could not assess COVID-19 effects on long-term outcomes.', 'The precise impact of COVID-19 on kidney structure and function and the incidence of chronic kidney disease in these patients require further investigation.', 'In conclusion, the prevalence of kidney disease in patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Wuhan, China, was high.', 'After adjustment for confounders, kidney disease on admission and

However, the idea that SARS-CoV 3C-like protease was the antiviral target of lopinavir was based purely on binding in computational modelling.', '21 Other protease inhibitors and nucleotide analogues (eg, remdesivir [Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA]) are potential candidates for treatment.', 'Combination treatment with virus-targeting and host-targeting agents to improve clinical outcome should be investigated.', 'Studies for SARS-CoV have shown that a high initial viral load was associated with death.', '22 However, our study only showed that the median viral load was 1 log 10 higher in severe cases than in mild cases, and the difference was not significant.', 'But, older age was associated with a higher peak viral load.', 'In a previous study of patients infected with SARS-CoV, older age was an independent factor associated with higher viral load, 23 as expected for immunosenescence, which impairs our innate and adaptive immune responses.', 'SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected for 20 days or longer in a third of patients who survived in our cohort, and one patient had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected for 25 days.', 'Prolonged detection of viral RNA of 20 days or longer was also commonly seen for patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infections.', '4, 16 Prolonged detection of viral RNA represents a challenge for the limited availability of hospital isolation facilities because patients might not be discharged until viral RNA is undetectable in respiratory specimens.', 'Further studies are warranted to ascertain whether patients are shedding live virus, by viral culture of the prolonged RT-PCR-positive specimens obtained from patients with concomitant seropositivity when shedded virions are coated with host antibodies which render them non-infectious.', 'A criterion for discontinuation of transmission-based precautions is a negative RT-qPCR result from two sets of nasopharyngeal and throat swab specimens.', 'In the current study, one patient with complete symptom resolution tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 again after 2 days of negative findings.', 'Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 might be excreted at low levels despite clinical recovery.', 'Thus, both serial viral load monitoring and antibody response should be considered when making decisions about infection control measures, because viral load seemed to be related inversely to serum antibody response in this study.', 'The antibody profile is vital for timing requests for serological assays and interpretation of antibody test results.', 'Serological diagnosis is important for patients who present late with a very low viral load, below the detection limit of RT-PCR assays.', 'Because most patients have rising antibody titres 10 days after symptom onset, collection of serial serum samples in the convalescent phase would be more useful.', 'Serum IgG amounts can rise at the same time or earlier than those of IgM against SARS-CoV-2.', 'By comparison with findings of a study on IgM and IgG EIA, in which more patients were seropositive for IgG than IgM at day 0 and day 5 of hospital admission, 24 a higher Anti-NP IgG', 'Anti-NP IgM proportion of patients in the current study also had earlier IgG than IgM seroconversion.', 'However, this finding could also be accounted for by a lower sensitivity of the IgM EIA, which warrants investi gations with more patients.', 'Serum antibody levels were not correlated with clinical severity.', 'Notably, one patient with severe disease had an early antibody response 6 days after symptom onset.', 'Deceased patients infected with SARS-CoV developed faster peak anti-spike antibody responses when compared with patients who recovered 25 and had subsequent reduced B-cell immunity with impaired neutralising ability.', 'In a SARS-CoV macaque model, anti-spike IgG stimulated pulmonary proinflammatory responses and caused acute lung injury.', '26 The detrimental effect of antispike IgG was attributable to the effect on wound-healing macrophages, which was mediated via the Fcγ receptor.', 'Our findings showing correlation between antibody level detected by EIA and virus neutralisation titre are especially important for design of vaccine studies, and use of convalescent plasma or therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, which could improve clinical outcome or paradoxically cause immuno pathological damage to the recipient.', 'Whole-genome sequencing on paired samples from four patients was successful and showed no differences in individually paired genome sequences.', 'However, single nucleotide polymorphisms were shown to emerge during hospitalisation for MERS-CoV infection, using a targeted sequencing approach.', '27 Further studies in more patients with samples obtained at longer intervals could be more informative.', 'A high viral load in throat wash and saliva (up to 10⁸ copies per mL of SARS-CoV RNA) was reported in 17 patients with SARS.', \"28 In a Chinese macaque model of SARS-CoV, salivary gland ducts were early targets of SARS-CoV and, therefore, were a likely source of the virions found in patients' saliva, particularly early in infection.\", '29 Because of these important findings, our study used posterior oropharyngeal saliva brought up by a throat-clearing manoeuvre to ascertain the temporal viral load profile.', 'The posterior oropharynx is the meeting point between secretions coming from the posterior nasopharynx and the salivary glands and respiratory secretions swept up from the tracheal-bronchial tree.', 'Testing of saliva could show viral shedding from both the salivary glands and the upper and lower respiratory tract.', 'Moreover, because of greater patient acceptability for posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples than for nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, we obtained 7·5 respiratory specimens per patient for testing.', 'Thus, our temporal viral load profile can be analysed by statistics, unlike previous clinical studies of viral kinetics of infections by highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses.', '8, 16 Further studies are needed to ascertain whether the salivary glands can be infected by SARS-CoV-2.', 'Our study has several limitations.', 'First, we could only include a few patients, and viral load and antibody titre data were not available everyday.', 'This limitation is a common problem in studies of emerging infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 16 The few patients enrolled does not allow for adjustment for potential confounding factors that could affect viral load or antibody response.', 'Second, 48% of patients enrolled had chronic medical illness, which is a higher proportion than that reported in a large clinical series (24%).', '30 Although a lower anti-RBD IgG level was noted among patients with comorbidities, further studies are warranted with more patients.', 'Third, posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples cannot differentiate whether the virus is coming from the nasopharynx or from secretions from the lower respiratory tract; thus, our study cannot indicate whether SARS-CoV-2 has a predilection for both upper and lower respiratory tract.', 'Moreover, some patients might not clear the throat effectively to cough out saliva from deep in the throat, which could decrease test sensitivity when compared with that of nasopharyngeal swabs, particularly in patients with predominant upper respiratory involvement or mild symptoms.', 'Finally, the most abundantly expressed internal NP might have some cross-antigenicity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (90% amino acid homology) and, occasionally, OC43-CoV (38% amino acid homology).', '31 Thus, the less abundantly expressed surface spike protein RBD, which is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and is the direct target for neutralising antibodies, was used to guard the specificity of our dual antibody assays.', '32 COVID-19 is an emerging infection with many unknowns.', 'This study has shed light on viral kinetics and antibody response in patients and provides scientific evidence for guiding infection control policies and therapeu tics.', 'Further virological and immunological studies are needed to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection; infection control measures should be reviewed with the rapidly evolving epidemiology of COVID-19.']}\n"

identified SARS-CoV-2) and its mutations were not sufficient to reach the threshold of forming an independent subtype, our evidence indicated ZJ01 may represent a specific evolution direction of SARS-CoV-2.', 'In this study, we first developed the C/T categorization system of SARS-CoV-2, which revealed the occurrence of possibly inheritable mutation at the very early stage of its evolution and the potential of continuing C/T subtype formation.', 'The TT type of ZJ01 was unique in our system.', 'Though a similar categorization system has been recently proposed 36 , they did not report such TT type in their 120 strains of SARS-CoV-2.', 'Besides, the C/T pattern could also be used to trace the route of virus infection and evolution.', 'For instance, we found 8 strains of T type with

itself triggering severe respiratory damage; on the other hand, the utilization of Furin may help scatter virus attack from lung to other organs, contributing to the phenomenon of decreased severity but increased liver/kidney dysfunction.', 'Nevertheless, all these speculations warrant further investigations.', 'To sum up, ZJ01 isolated form mild COVID-19 patient of Zhejiang province represents a

targets are ciliated cells.', 'Interestingly, various reports indicate an association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and anosmia, suggesting an alteration not restricted to the respiratory tissue, but that might also include the olfactory sensory epithelium.', 'We explored this possibility by generating RNA-seq libraries from human neuroepithelium, in which we found significant expression of ACE2',

sustentacular cells and other non-neuronal cell types in the olfactory neuroepithelium, but not olfactory sensory neurons, coexpress TMPRSS2 and ACE2, the two key players in the binding and entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into human cells.', 'A fair question is to ask how common TMPRSS2 and ACE2 coexpression is in human cells.', 'A first answer, although limited to the 26 nose cell types analyzed here, is provided in Figure 2 A: not often.', 'We also looked at various other human cell types using available scRNA-seq datasets, corresponding to various organs (data not shown) and in particular to neuronal tissue (Figure 3) , and found TMPRSS2 and ACE2 coexpression to be a very rare characteristic.', 'Naturally, much is still to be learned about the players involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cells.', 'Thus, although ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are currently believed to represent the major players during cell entry, other molecules, such as CD147 in particular, may also play a significant role 24 .', 'How likely is it that the coexpression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in olfactory sustentacular cells is at the origin of the SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia?', 'And why are horizontal basal cells that also coexpress TMPRSS2 and ACE2 not prime candidates?', 'First, given the slow rate of neuronal renewal in the main olfactory epithelium and the apparent rapid development of SARS-CoV-2-triggered anosmia, a perturbation of the stem cell pool constituted by the horizontal basal cells appears unlikely to represent an immediate disturbance to the system.', 'Second, the significant amounts of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 transcripts we observed in sustentacular cells are in the same range as the one observed in respiratory ciliated cells, suggesting at least that sustentacular cells play in the same league in terms of SARS-CoV-2 receptors.', 'Third, sustentacular cells are in direct contact with the olfactory cavity, and thus with anything that enters the nose.', 'Finally, a known and critical role is played by sustentacular cells in the maintenance of the olfactory neuroepithelium integrity: if they die, the whole neuroepithelium disaggregates, leading to anosmia.', 'Taken together, and despite the fact that one cannot exclude inflammation and the infection of other non-neuronal cell types in the olfactory neuroepithelium as an origin of the SARS-CoV-2-induced anosmia, the link between the viral molecular entry tools expressed by olfactory sustentacular cells and the chemosensory alteration appears quite credible.', 'Naturally, a next step would be the study of the olfactory epithelium of a mouse model expressing the human ACE2/TMPRSS2 in sustentacular cells, and nasal biopsies of human olfactory neuroepithelia just after SARS-CoV-2 infection.', 'The idea that viruses may affect directly or indirectly the integrity and function of the sensory part of the olfactory system is not new.', 'Viruses may indeed affect the neuroepithelium in different ways.', 'They often alter specific cell types, including neurons.', 'For example, olfactory sensory neurons and sustentacular cells were shown to be major portals of host entry of the Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4', 'The

anomalies, or rather olfactory perturbations that may drastically affect the flavor of food, is unclear.', 'However, this potential double effect on two chemosensory systems that share nothing at the periphery may suggest a more central alteration, involving for example a direct infection of the brain by SARS-CoV-2.', 'Again, such viral migration to the central nervous system, and in particular from the olfactory neuroepithelium, would not be a first.', 'SARS-CoV particles (that is the virus responsible for the previous SARS epidemic in 2002) have in fact been found in the human brain 18-20
